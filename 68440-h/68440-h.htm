<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
THE RUINED VILLAGE
</h3>

<p>
On the afternoon of a certain day in spring
a party of eighteen men was marching through
the rocky, bush-covered country near the north-western
corner of Lake Chad, in Northern Nigeria.
It consisted of two white men, in khaki and sun
helmets, and sixteen stalwart Hausas, wearing
nothing but their loin-cloths, but carrying on their
heads boxes and bundles of all shapes and sizes.
The white men and nine of the negroes had rifles
slung over their backs.
</p>

<p>
They were marching wearily.  Since early
morning, almost without stopping, they had been
trudging their toilsome way over parched and
barren land, only once discovering a water-hole
at which they were able to slake their burning
thirst.
</p>

<p>
For the greater part of the day the sun had
beat upon them fiercely; but the sky was now
overclouded, and a keen north-east wind had
sprung up&mdash;the harmattan of the desert&mdash;blowing
full in their faces, stinging their skins and filling
mouths and ears and nostrils with the particles
of fine grey dust which it swept along in its
desolating course.
</p>

<p>
The jaded carriers, who were wont to enliven
the march with song and chatter, were now silent.
The two Englishmen in advance, bending forward
to keep the grit out of their eyes, tramped along,
side by side, with an air of dejection and fatigue.
</p>

<p>
"We are down on our luck, old man," said Hugh
Royce presently, turning his back upon the wind.
"The village can't be far away, if Drysdale's map
is correct; but we can't go on much farther without
a long rest."
</p>

<p>
"It's rank bad luck, as you say," replied Tom
Challis.  "It's not as if we had been over-marching;
we've really taken it pretty easy; but we didn't
reckon with sickness.  These Hausas look as
strong as horses, but I doubt whether half of them
will be able to lift their loads to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"When we get to the village, we'll let them slack
for a day or two, and dose them well.  I'll tell
John; it will encourage them to stick it a little
longer."
</p>

<p>
He beckoned up a strapping negro, the
head-man of the company, upon whom a former
employer had bestowed the name John in place of his
own&mdash;a succession of clicks and gurgles which white
men found unpronounceable.  Telling him the
decision just come to, the leader of the expedition
ordered him to acquaint the men with it, and urge
them to persevere a little longer.
</p>

<p>
The weary, willing carriers perked up a little
at the prospect of a holiday, and began to talk to
one another of how much they would eat.  It did
not matter, they agreed, if they made themselves
ill, for the little balls out of the white men's bottles
would soon set them to rights again.
</p>

<p>
Hugh Royce was one of those hardy persons
whom wealth does not spoil.  Inheriting, at the
age of twenty-three, a large fortune from an uncle,
he resolved to realise his dearest ambition&mdash;to
travel into some little-known region of the world,
not for mere sport, but to study its animals and
birds, and add something to the general stock of
knowledge.
</p>

<p>
A chance meeting with a friend of his, named
Drysdale, who had just returned from a sporting
expedition in Nigeria, led him to choose that
country as a promising field of discovery.
</p>

<p>
Being sociably inclined, he wanted a companion.
Drysdale himself could not join him, but he
happened to mention that traces of tin had recently
been found near one of the tributaries of the
River Yo.  This led Royce to think of his
school-fellow, Tom Challis, a mining engineer who was
not getting on so fast as he would have liked.  He
went to Challis and proposed that they should go
together, Challis to prospect for tin, while he
himself pursued his studies in natural history.
</p>

<p>
"If things look well," he said, "we'll start a
tin mine, and go half-shares."
</p>

<p>
"That's hardly fair to you, as you're going to
stand all expenses," replied Challis.  "I shall be
satisfied with a quarter."
</p>

<p>
"You're too modest, Tom.  Well, I want your
company, so I'll agree to a third, nothing less.  So
that's settled."
</p>

<p>
Royce purchased a quantity of tinned goods;
medical stores; prints, mirrors, and beads for
trading with the natives; rifles and ammunition;
a tent and other necessaries; and they left
Southampton one February day for the Gold Coast.
Here they engaged a staff of experienced Hausa
carriers&mdash;called "boys," whatever their age might
be&mdash;and started for the interior.
</p>

<p>
That was several weeks ago, and they were now
approaching the tin-bearing region marked on
the map with which Drysdale had provided his
friend.
</p>

<p>
About an hour after the promise of a rest had
stimulated the carriers, they were further
encouraged by striking a native track, which indicated
the proximity of a village.  Tired as they were,
they quickened their pace, and another half-hour's
march brought them to cultivated fields of millet
and ground-nuts.
</p>

<p>
The white men, walking ahead of the party, looked
forward eagerly for the conical roofs of the village
huts, which they expected to see rising above the
crops in the distance, and were surprised to find
that nothing of the sort was in sight.
</p>

<p>
"It must be a bigger place than I thought,"
said Royce.  "A small village wouldn't have such
extensive fields.  Drysdale marks the people as
friendly; I hope we shall find them so."
</p>

<p>
The narrow track wound through the fields, high
stalks growing on either side.  A sudden turn
brought them in sight of an object which caused
them to halt, and struck them with a foreboding
of ill.
</p>

<p>
Lying in a curiously huddled posture across the
track was the body of a black man.
</p>

<p>
Insensibly lightening their tread, they
approached it, and found that the man was dead, and
bore marks of slashing and defacement.
</p>

<p>
"There's been bad work here," said Royce in
a whisper.
</p>

<p>
They looked ahead; no one was in sight.  They
listened; there was not a sound but the chirping
of insects in the crops.
</p>

<p>
Unslinging their rifles, they went slowly on,
oppressed with a sense of tragedy; and a few steps
more disclosed a scene for which their discovery
of the dead man had partly prepared them.  The
absence of the well-known conical roofs was
explained.  The site of what had once been a
flourishing village was now desolate, a black waste.
Great heaps of ashes marked the spots where the
cane huts had stood, and here and there lay bodies
stiff in death, from which a number of sated
carrion birds rose noisily into the air at the
approach of men.
</p>

<p>
Their hearts sank as they contemplated the
pitiful scene.  It was a new thing in their
experience, though it represented one of the
commonest of tragedies in that region.  The village
had recently been raided by a more powerful
neighbour; its men had been killed, its women and
children carried off into slavery.
</p>

<p>
Happily, such raids are becoming less frequent
as the Great Powers strengthen their grip on the
areas marked on the maps as their spheres of
influence.  But in the remoter parts of those vast
territories, life still proceeds much as it has done
for hundreds or thousands of years past.
</p>

<p>
The horror of the scene, the misery it
represented, sank deep into the hearts of the two
Englishmen.  And mingled with the distress which
every humane person must have felt, was their
consciousness of the bearing this discovery would
have upon their own situation.  They had hoped
to make this village their resting-place, to give
their men time to recover from the sickness which
had crept upon them of late, to renew their store
of fresh provisions.  But it was now late in the
afternoon; the next village marked on the map
was fifteen or twenty miles away; the fatigue and
weakness of the carriers rendered it impossible
for the expedition to advance so far.
</p>

<p>
"We are indeed down on our luck," said Challis
gloomily.  "This will just about be the finishing
stroke for our boys."
</p>

<p>
"They can't move another step, that's certain,"
said Royce.  "We shall have to camp somewhere
about here for the night.  Here they are.  Look at
their faces!  I never saw fright so clearly expressed.
We must put the best face on it with them."
</p>

<p>
The carriers had halted at the edge of the village
clearing, and stood like images of terror and despair.
Royce went up to them.
</p>

<p>
"This is very bad, John," he said to the
head-man.  "Keep the boys as cheerful as you can.
They had better put down their loads against those
palm-trees yonder.  Find the village well, and get
some water; then the strongest of them must build
a zariba for the night.  Get up our tent, and then
we'll talk things over."
</p>

<p>
"Boys 'fraid of Tubus, sah."
</p>

<p>
"Tubus?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sah&mdash;Tubus done dat."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"Savvy cuts on black fella's face, sah.  Tubus'
knives done dat."
</p>

<p>
"Well, they needn't be afraid.  The Tubus won't
come again; if they did, they wouldn't face our
rifles.  Fix things up, and then come back.  We'll
see what can be done."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
THE FIGHT AT DAWN
</h3>

<p>
Royce knew the Tubus by repute as a fierce
and bloodthirsty tribe, living in French territory
beyond the River Yo, whose raids across the border
were notorious.  It was certainly to be hoped that
the peaceful objects of his expedition would not
be hindered by encounters with those turbulent
savages.
</p>

<p>
The first consideration, however, was the welfare
of his boys.  They depended for their food on
the willingness of the natives to sell.  Hitherto
there had been no difficulty in this respect; but
they carried only enough for a few days' supply,
and at present their provisions were exhausted.
The crops of this village were not yet ripe; the
village itself was absolutely bare; it was of the
first importance that food should be obtained at
once.
</p>

<p>
As a result of a consultation with Challis and
the headman, Royce decided to push on with John
to the next village and buy food there.
</p>

<p>
"What if that has been raided too?" suggested
Challis, as they talked it over.
</p>

<p>
"We must hope for the best," Royce answered.
</p>

<p>
"And it's pretty risky, you two going alone
through a country recently raided."
</p>

<p>
"How long ago were the Tubus here, do you
think?" Royce asked John.
</p>

<p>
"Two free days, sah."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, it's likely that they've gone back
to their own ground.  For us it's a choice of two
evils, and we must chance it.  With good luck, we
shall get to the next village before dark.  I'll
engage carriers there, and we ought to be back
here with plenty of grub by to-morrow night."
</p>

<p>
They set off.  Both were in good condition, and
they made rapid progress.  But the country was
trackless, and Royce could only direct his course
roughly by Drysdale's map.
</p>

<p>
The short dusk was falling without their having
come on any signs of human dwellings.  In another
half-hour it would be quite dark, and Royce
reluctantly but prudently decided that they must
take shelter for the night, for fear of becoming
hopelessly lost, and go on in the morning.
</p>

<p>
The country was bare, consisting of rocky ground
sparsely covered with scrub.  It offered nothing
that gave promise of a comfortable defence against
the night cold, and Royce had almost reconciled
himself to spending the hours in the open when
suddenly he caught sight, on the crest of a low hill
about a mile to the left, of what appeared to be
the ruins of a small building.  Such ruins are to
be met with here and there in the remotest depths
of the great continent, the relics of ancient
civilisations long vanished.  There were no signs of life
about this building, and Royce resolved to take
shelter there.
</p>

<p>
They struck off to the left, climbed the hill,
and, after a careful survey of the neighbourhood,
approached the ruin.  It turned out to be a
dismantled stone fort, overgrown in parts with
vegetation, but in a fair state of preservation.
The outer wall was complete; inside, the principal
chamber, which had once, no doubt, been the
headquarters of a garrison, was roofless, and such
timber-work as there had been was either burnt
or had been carried away.  Some smaller rooms
were still covered from the sky, and it was in one
of these that Royce determined to repose during the
night.
</p>

<p>
They had brought with them a few biscuits and
a small tin of preserved mutton, and they made a
meagre supper.  John having noticed, as they
approached the fort, the runs of ground game
among the bushes, set a few snares, in the hope
of providing next day's breakfast.  He returned
with a huge armful of leaves and grasses to spread
on the stone floor of the room chosen for their
night's lodging.
</p>

<p>
"It's the first time I've been littered down like
a horse," said Royce to himself, with faint
amusement.  "There's no telling what one may come
to!"
</p>

<p>
"No berry comfy, sah," said John, when he had
laid these rough beds in opposite corners.  "All
can do."
</p>

<p>
"It will do very well, John," returned Royce.
"I suppose we shan't be disturbed by lions or any
other unpleasant visitors?"
</p>

<p>
"No fink so, sah."
</p>

<p>
"Should we light a fire, do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sah; no good.  Fire make lions 'fraid;
oh yes! but no make bad mans 'fraid."
</p>

<p>
"I see&mdash;it might drive off beasts, but attract
men?  Very well.  I don't suppose I shall sleep
much, anyway."
</p>

<p>
Royce had often admired the negro's ability to
sleep anywhere and at any time, and to awake to
full alertness and activity in a moment.  Like a
dog, he seems to have no need of the preliminary
yawnings and stretchings to which a civilised man
has accustomed himself.  John fell asleep as soon
as he had curled himself up on his grass bed.  His
master lay awake for a long time, listening to the
rustle of the wind in the foliage that clothed the
ruins, fancying that he heard the grunt of a lion
and the bark of a jackal far away, thinking of
Challis in his camp, and of the terrible scene of
desolation in the ruined village.
</p>

<p>
A more experienced traveller would have taken
that matter philosophically; Royce was greatly
perturbed.  He pictured in his mind the barbarians
swooping upon the village, the massacre
and pillage, the driving of women and children
into slavery; and he shuddered at the misery
which had fallen upon simple and inoffensive people.
</p>

<p>
He felt anxiety, too, about the future of his
own little company.  The region of which he was
in search was apparently situated near the lands
of the Tubus, the raiding tribe whose name was
dreaded by his boys; and the prospect of coming
into conflict with them made him uneasy.  Not
that he was a coward, or shrank from the possible
necessity of fighting; but his object was peaceable,
and he wished with all his heart that it might be
attained without offence to the native peoples,
without the shedding of blood.  Yet his indignation
burnt so fiercely within him, that he knew he
would not be able to refrain from striking a blow
for any hapless villagers who might be threatened
with disaster at the hands of a savage enemy.
</p>

<p>
Turning over these things in his mind, and
envying John, whose loud breathing proclaimed
that no anxieties disturbed his repose, he lay
wakeful for several hours, until he, too, fell asleep.
He slept very heavily, as might have been
expected of a man tired out by exhausting marches
under a hot sun.  The night was cool, the atmosphere
was pure, and the young Englishman's rest
was as peaceful as though there were no wild beast
or savage man in the world.
</p>

<p>
When he awoke, the ghostly light of dawn was
glimmering in the open doorway of the room.  Like
his countrymen everywhere, he turned over on his
back, stretched himself, rubbed his eyes, and sat
up.  Where was John?  The heap of grass in the
opposite corner was vacant.
</p>

<p>
"He's gone to examine his snares, I suppose,"
he said to himself.  "I wonder if there's a stream
where I can take a dip."
</p>

<p>
He rose, stretched himself again, feeling a little
stiff, walked through the doorway, and entered
one of the passages that led to the outside.  He was
just turning a corner when, with a suddenness
that took him all aback, he came face to face with
a negro, a man of huge stature, topping him by
several inches.
</p>

<p>
The white man and the black were equally
surprised.  Both came to a halt, and stood eyeing
each other for a moment in silence.
</p>

<p>
The passage was open to the sky, but the light
of morning was as yet so faint that neither could
see very clearly.
</p>

<p>
All at once the negro, with a roar like that of
a wild beast, whipped a curved sword out of a
belt about his waist, and, springing forward,
delivered a furious sweeping cut which, if it had
taken effect, must have severed Royce's head from
his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for him, however, he was quick of
eye and wit, and nimble in his movements.  At
school he had had no match in boxing and fencing.
Being absolutely unarmed, he had no means of
parrying the stroke; but he dropped on one knee,
and the scimitar whistled within an inch of his
crown, striking with a crashing stroke the wall on
his right hand.
</p>

<p>
While the negro was still bent forward with the
force of his blow, Royce sprang low at his knees,
and, tugging them towards him, brought the man
with a thud to the floor.  The sword fell from his
hand and clashed on the stone flags, and Royce
reached down to get hold of it.  But the negro
sprang to his feet with agility amazing in so huge a
man, and hurled himself upon the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
Royce had just time to straighten himself and
prevent himself from being thrown down; the
next moment the negro's arms were about him;
he felt hot breath upon his face, and saw the
gleaming teeth and infuriated eyes of a man from
whom he knew he could expect no mercy.
</p>

<p>
He was well acquainted with the styles of
wrestling in vogue in England&mdash;the Cumberland,
the Devon, the Lancashire; but he was instantly
aware that the negro's method was none of these.
It was, in fact, a form of wrestling like that which
had been practised ages ago in the Olympic games,
and had no doubt been introduced into Northern
Africa by the Romans in the days of Cæsar and
Pompey.  It resembled the catch-as-catch-can
style of Lancashire more nearly than the lighter
styles with which Royce was familiar.
</p>

<p>
The negro's aim seemed to be to throttle his
opponent, or to squeeze the breath out of his body;
and Royce, struggle as he might, felt the thick,
muscular arms gripping him more and more closely.
Slighter in build, he had no chance of employing
the feints and tricks which might have compensated
for a less powerful physique in dealing with an
Englishman.  In that straining grasp, there was
no hope for the lesser man; in a few seconds the
struggle must end.
</p>

AT GRIPS WITH THE NEGRO
</p>

<p>
The encounter, the coming to grips, had
happened so swiftly that Royce had had no time to
think that there was help at hand in the shape of
John.  But now, at this critical moment, when he
felt that the very life was being crushed out of him,
he remembered the staunch companion of his
journey, who could not be far away.
</p>

<p>
Making a desperate effort to fill his lungs, he
uttered a shout, or rather a choking gurgle, which
no one would have recognised as the voice of an
Englishman.  The negro laughed, anticipating the
moment when the white man would lie limp and
lifeless at his feet.  Bub John, climbing the hill
with a rabbit dangling in his hand, heard the two
sounds&mdash;the gasping cry, the loud, mocking laugh.
Hastening forward at a run, he shouted aloud,
giving a long, penetrating note like the yodel of
the Swiss mountain shepherd.  The sound, growing
louder moment by moment, came to the ears of
the negro.  He realised instantly that, unless he
could dispose of the Englishman at once, he would
soon have two men to deal with.
</p>

<p>
The encouraging sound gave Royce new strength.
He put forth his last energies to resist the strangling
grip.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Yoi-aloo!  Yoi-aloo!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The newcomer was close at hand.  The panting
negro lowered his arms, caught Royce about the
hips, and tried to lift him, intending to dash him
upon the floor.  Royce flung his legs about the
giant's thighs, stiffened his muscles, and dragged
with all his force upon the negro's shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Yoi-aloo!  Yoi-aloo!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The game was up!  The negro dared not wait
longer.  Loosening his grip, he wrenched himself
out of Royce's entwining arms, thrust him away,
and, turning about, rushed through the passage
into the open.  There he saw John hurrying up
within twenty paces of him, and swerving to the
left, in five seconds had disappeared among the
bushes.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
THE STORY OF GORUBA
</h3>

<p>
Royce, when the negro left him, was breathless
from the struggle.  But he had the presence of
mind to run back to the room where he had passed
the night, pick up his rifle and revolver from the
floor, and hurry to the entrance.  There John met
him.  The anxious alarm on the Hausa's face gave
way to a broad smile when he saw that his master
was safe.
</p>

<p>
"Where is that ruffian?" asked Royce, looking
round for his assailant.
</p>

<p>
"Him run away quick," replied John, pointing
to the bushes.  "Berry much 'fraid of me."
</p>

<p>
"You were just in time, John.  He was crushing
me to a jelly.  It's a lesson to me not to part with
my revolver for an instant.  You saw no other
black men about?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sah.  Him berry big chap, sure 'nuff."
</p>

<p>
"A giant!  I am bruised all over.  I met him
as I was coming out for a bathe, and he sprang at
me at once.  Why should he do that?"
</p>

<p>
"Bad fella, sah."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay; but it was something more than
original sin.  He went for me with as much
ferocity as an eagle whose nest I disturbed once.
Does this place belong to him, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
John could only repeat that the man was a
"bad fella."  But Royce felt a good deal puzzled.
The negro's savage onslaught might be explained
by his regarding the white man as a robber, but
there appeared to be nothing in the place worth
stealing.  It was strange that he should have so
fiercely resented what was, after all, an innocent
intrusion.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have another look round before we
start," said Royce.  "Or, rather, I will.  You keep
guard at the doorway, John, and call me if you
see anyone moving about outside."
</p>

<p>
Royce searched the building thoroughly.  The
result confirmed his overnight impression, that it
was in a fair state of preservation.  But there was
nothing in any of the rooms to indicate present or
even remote occupation.  Except for fragments of
stone and rubble, they were bare.  There was
nothing to tempt a robber.  Royce could only
conclude that the man had attacked him from an
instinct of self-preservation.  What had led him to
enter the building was a mystery.
</p>

<p>
Royce returned to John, who during his absence
had kindled a fire, skinned the rabbit, and set it
to roast.  They made a good breakfast, then started
in the direction of the village where Royce hoped
to purchase food for his men.
</p>

<p>
"We must keep a good look-out," he said, "in
case that fellow should be one of a band prowling
about here.  He won't be difficult to recognise.
There can't be many men of his height and size.
And if there were, I should know him again by
some strange marks on his face.  Why do these
black men gash themselves, John?"
</p>

<p>
"To make him look pretty, sah."
</p>

<p>
"Um!  They've a queer notion of beauty, then."
</p>

<p>
Anxious to accomplish his errand and return to
Challis, Royce pushed on as rapidly as possible.
The country was pathless, for the most part flat,
with undulations here and there, covered with
thick bush varied by an occasional gum-tree.
Drysdale's rough sketch-map gave him little more
than a bare direction, and he had to trust a good
deal to luck.  After three hours' steady marching,
which ought to have brought them to the village,
if the estimate of its distance were correct, they
were still in the same wild, barren country, without
a sign of mankind.  It seemed probable that they
had overshot the mark, so, after taking a short
rest, they altered their direction in the hope of
discovering a path.
</p>

<p>
It was late in the afternoon, and they were very
tired, when at last they struck into a narrow,
beaten track, far to the left of their original course.
</p>

<p>
"This looks promising," said Royce.  "We'll
make a spurt, John."
</p>

<p>
Another half-hour brought them to cultivated
fields.  Crossing these, they found themselves
faced by a mud wall, fourteen or fifteen feet high,
pierced by a single gate.  This was closed.
</p>

<p>
"It's a town, after all," said Royce; "not a
village.  So much the better, if the people are
friendly.  Give them a call, John."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-029"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-029.jpg" alt="JOHN ADDRESSES THE SENTRY" />
<br />
JOHN ADDRESSES THE SENTRY
</p>

<p>
The Hausa let out his long yodelling cry.  A
head was seen peering over the top of the wall.
John lifted both hands, and spread them, palms
open, as a sign of friendliness; then began an
address in the native tongue, somewhat as follows:
</p>

<p>
"Ho, you admirable watchman of a noble
chief!  Tell your kind and worthy lord that a
stranger from the lands of the Great White King
seeks to look upon his face, and have a friendly
talk with him.  My lord and master is a very great
man, with horses and cattle in number as the
grains in a cornfield, and it is a great honour that
he does to your chief.  Open, then, your gate, and
let this great lord enter; and, as he passes, let
your people fall to the ground, and throw earth
upon their bodies, as befits folk who are but as
worms in his sight."
</p>

<p>
Unconscious of the extravagant claims made on
his behalf, Royce leant on his rifle, waiting.  The
head disappeared.  Some minutes elapsed; then
the watchman came back to his perch, and a long
conversation ensued between him and the Hausa,
who grew more and more excited, and raised his
voice until it became almost a yell.
</p>

<p>
"What is it all about?" asked Royce, beginning
to suspect that his man was growing impolite.
</p>

<p>
"Son of a dog, dat fella!" replied John
indignantly.  "He want to know too much.  Talk
'bout sah's father and mother, how many wives,
what he come for, too much!"
</p>

<p>
"Did you tell him I want to buy food?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sah; I tell him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then do so at once," Royce interrupted sternly.
</p>

<p>
In a more subdued tone of voice, John gave his
message.  The man again withdrew.
</p>

<p>
After another interval, the gate was thrown open,
and Royce, entering, found himself among a band
of stalwart natives, carrying long, broad-bladed
spears, and marked on each cheek, near the ear,
with five or six narrow cuts, the badge of their
tribe.  Escorted by them, and watched by a
curious crowd of townsfolk, Royce proceeded to
the chief's large mud house in the centre of the
town.
</p>

<p>
On entering he was greeted with the words:
"<i>Sanu, bature!</i>" (Hail, white man!) from a stout,
pleasant-faced, bearded black man, somewhat past
middle age, who motioned to him to be seated,
and ordered one of his slaves to bring forward a
present of a roasted fowl.
</p>

<p>
The customary salutations passed between host
and visitor.  Royce had already learnt to endure
this lengthy ceremony with patience.  It was
something like this:
</p>

<p>
<i>John</i>: "Hail, chief!  Is it well with you?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Chief</i>: "It is well."
</p>

<p>
<i>John</i>: "Allah be praised!  Is it well with your
wives?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Chief</i>: "It is well."
</p>

<p>
<i>John</i>: "Allah be praised!  Is it well with your
children?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Chief</i>: "It is well."
</p>

<p>
<i>John</i>: "Allah be praised!  And your horses?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Chief</i>: "It is well."
</p>

<p>
<i>John</i>: "Allah be praised!  And your cattle?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Chief</i>: "They are well."
</p>

<p>
<i>John</i>: "Allah be praised!  Your house and
all that is yours?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Chief</i>: "All is well."
</p>

<p>
<i>John</i>: "Allah be praised!"
</p>

<p>
And then they got to business.  The chief
apologised for the delay in opening the gate.  His
watchmen had to be careful, because it was
reported that Tubus were in the neighbourhood.
A few days before a fugitive had come in from the
westward, and told how his village had been raided
and destroyed.  From the chief's description,
Royce gathered that this was the village which he
had himself seen, and near which Challis was
encamped.
</p>

<p>
Royce then explained the object of his visit,
instructing John to translate exactly what he
said, without adding or subtracting anything.
The chief at once agreed to sell a quantity of millet
and manioc for the men, and to present Royce with
a few dozen eggs&mdash;an offer which Royce gracefully
accepted, though he knew that most of the eggs
would turn out to be bad.  The African native can
never understand the white man's squeamishness
in the matter of addled eggs.
</p>

<p>
The next question was about the transportation
of the food to the camp, nearly twenty miles
distant.  At first the chief, for fear of the Tubus,
was reluctant to supply carriers.  But when
Royce explained that there had been no sign of
Tubus on the way, and that the area of their
depredations appeared to be considerably to the
west, he yielded, and gave orders for the food to
be loaded into calabashes, and for a dozen slaves
to be ready to start with them in the morning.
</p>

<p>
It was clearly too late for a start to be made
that evening, though Royce was very anxious to
get back to his friend.  He accepted the chief's
hospitality for the night, and, though very tired,
kept up a tedious conversation with him through
John.  In the course of this he related the incident
of the early morning.
</p>

<p>
The chief seemed amused at the thought of a
wrestling match between an Englishman and a
negro, and laughed heartily at the negro running
away on hearing John's cry, "<i>Yoi-aloo!</i>" which
he made the Hausa repeat again and again.  But
his amusement soon gave place to alarm, his smiles
to a look of thoughtfulness.  He had asked Royce
to describe the negro.  He seemed little impressed
by details of the man's height and size, but when
Royce mentioned that he had noticed two straight
cuts down the middle of each cheek he uttered a
sudden, sharp exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"Goruba!"
</p>

<p>
"What does he mean by Goruba?" asked Royce
of John, after a brief silence.
</p>

<p>
The chief seemed to deliberate whether he should
speak or not.  At last he said:
</p>

<p>
"I will tell the white man&mdash;my friend.  Years
ago I was chief of only a small village, and lord of
little wealth.  And I sought to increase my wealth
by prudent trading, to which end I hunted the
elephant, and sold his tusks to merchants from the
East.  And one time, having got together some
few tusks in readiness for the barter, I was beset
in my village by a horde of strange warriors, armed
with guns, a terror to all my people.  And these
evil-doers came to me and made me captive, and
demanded that I should deliver up to them those
few tusks which were the spoil of my hunting.
And, when I refused, they treated me shamefully
and cruelly, so that I bear the marks on my body
to this day.  And there was no help for me, no
hope of deliverance; and then, for the safety
of my life, I was fain to yield, and saw myself
robbed of the treasure that had fallen to my
spear.
</p>

<p>
"And the captain of those wretches, he that
put me to the torture, was a man of vast stature
and the strength of a giant, Goruba by name.
He was from the east country, the slave of Rabeh,
King of Dar Runga, who laid waste all the lands
on this side of the great lake, and whose warriors
were as locusts on the face of the earth.
</p>

<p>
"It was a good day for all this country when
Rabeh was slain, and his men were scattered to
the winds.  I knew not what had become of
Goruba, one of his chiefest captains; but in very
truth it was he that laid hands on you, for his
stature and those marks upon his cheeks betray
him.  And this news that you give me is heavy
upon my heart, for without doubt Goruba is again
prowling like a lion about these lands, and many a
village will fall a prey to him."
</p>

<p>
Royce did his best to reassure the chief, pointing
out that Goruba had been alone, and there was
no evidence that he was the leader of any
considerable body of men.  This somewhat heartened
the old man, who declared, however, that he would
henceforth be doubly watchful, and advised the
white man to leave the country as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
"I shall go at my own time," said Royce quietly.
"I thank you for your warning, and will do what
I can to repay your kindness."
</p>

<p>
Next morning he left the village with John and
a dozen carriers, well loaded with food-stuffs, and
hastened at his best pace to rejoin his friend.

CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
RUSHED BY TUBUS
</h3>

<p>
Challis, after Royce had left him, felt somewhat
uneasy.  Royce had spoken hopefully of getting
back on the following day, but Challis, remembering
the difficulties of finding the way in a strange
country, was pretty sure that Royce had
overestimated his powers, and was prepared to be left
in sole charge for at least two days, and perhaps
three.  It was not a pleasant prospect, for the
raiders could not be very far away, and the
possibility of being attacked was disturbing.  He kept
a smiling face, however, and said nothing about his
anxieties to the boys.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to do was to form as secure a
camp as possible.  The camping arrangements
had been interrupted by the discussion leading to
Royce's departure.  As soon as Royce was gone,
Challis took the matter in hand.
</p>

<p>
The spot which Royce had suggested as suitable
for the camp was a knoll, on which a few palm-trees
grew, at one end of the village, and Challis was
rather surprised to find that, during his conversation
with Royce, the Hausas had not made a start.
Wearing woe-begone expressions on their faces,
they were squatting beside their packages.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Kulana," said Challis to the second in
command, "what are you all idling for?  Carry
the stuff to those palm-trees yonder."
</p>

<p>
The men got up obediently, but they appeared
to have a strange hesitation in lifting their loads.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come!" said Challis.  "I know that
you are done up, but you are not so bad as all that.
Besides, it's only a few yards away, and the sooner
we form camp the sooner you'll get to sleep."
</p>

<p>
There was a murmuring among them.  Still
they did not offer to lift the bundles.
</p>

<p>
Challis curbed his rising anger.  The men were
usually so willing that he wished not to be hard on
them.  And both Royce and he had already taken
much interest in studying the queer moods and
ideas of these Africans.
</p>

<p>
"What is troubling them, Kulana?" he asked
quietly.
</p>

<p>
The Hausa looked him full in the face, and, seeing
no anger there, replied:
</p>

<p>
"No want camp dar, sah&mdash;berry bad place."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Why is that?"
</p>

<p>
And then the man began to pour out an explanation
of which at first Challis could make nothing.
Kulana's English was not adequate to express his
thoughts.  He talked of "debbils" and "bad
medicine," and went through a pantomime of
gestures expressing fear and fright, the other men
listening intently, and murmuring approval now
and then.
</p>

<p>
After a time, however, Challis had a glimmering of
light.
</p>

<p>
"You think the spirits of the dead men haunt
the village&mdash;is that it?  And you are afraid they
will come and bother you during the night?"
</p>

<p>
"Sah savvy all 'bout it," said the man, delighted
that his meaning was understood.
</p>

<p>
The others clapped their hands, and looked much
more cheerful.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't want you to see black ghosts,
I'm sure," Challis went on.  "I don't know that
I'd like to see them myself.  We'll find another
place."
</p>

<p>
The men shouted, and springing to their feet,
hoisted their loads with alacrity.  Challis reflected
that the work of constructing a camp more in the
open would be good for them, preventing them
from brooding over their troubles, real and
imaginary.
</p>

<p>
After a rapid glance around, he led them to an
open spot at some little distance from the village,
and ordered them to make a small zariba with
branches from the bushes around.  It was an
excellent situation for a camp.  Its openness
rendered it possible to detect the approach of an
enemy, and a small stream running close by
furnished an ample supply of water.
</p>

<p>
As he had expected, the work of cutting the
bushes took the men's minds from their misfortunes.
They soon began to chatter with their usual
cheerfulness.  By nightfall they had constructed a
thick fence six feet high and several yards square.
The tent was erected in the middle of the enclosure,
the baggage was placed against one of the walls,
and the men, tired out, but no longer despondent,
were ready for their supper.
</p>

<p>
Challis dealt out pills to the ailing ones, promised
them all a long rest on the following day, and spoke
confidently of the speedy return of his companion
with ample supplies.  He arranged for the watching
of the camp during the night, and, as an extra
precaution, set his alarm clock, when he himself
turned in, so that it wakened him in an hour.
Then he took a look round, set the clock again
for an hour ahead, and so on, through the night.
He enjoyed the inestimable power of sleeping at
any minute.
</p>

<p>
The night passed quietly.  In the morning,
Challis sent two of the men outside the zariba to
fetch water and to take a look round.
</p>

<p>
When they returned they were rather excited.
They explained that they had made two discoveries.
One was that across the stream lay an extensive
swamp, upon which they had seen a large flock of
birds pecking for worms.  The other was that a
little farther off was a banana plantation, which
had escaped the ravages of the raiders.
</p>

<p>
"Good boys!" said Challis.  "We will make
some use of your news by and by."
</p>

<p>
The presence of the birds and the bananas
afforded a welcome opportunity of replenishing their
scanty larder.  Challis decided to go out and try
his skill as a sportsman.  There would be some
risk, of course, that the noise of his gun might
attract the notice of undesirable visitors; but there
was very little food of any kind left, and poultry
would be a treat to the men.  In view of the
possibility of Royce's return being delayed, it
seemed too good a chance to be neglected.  Besides,
he reflected, there was no other village in the
neighbourhood, and the raiders, having accomplished
their destructive work only too completely,
were probably by this time far away.  After he
had made a bag of birds, he would send out some
men to gather bananas, and the party would revel
in a regular banquet.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, he ordered Kulana to keep a careful
watch, and on no account to allow the men to move
outside the zariba; then, taking his shot-gun, he
set out for the swamp, with the two who had
brought the information, to retrieve the game.
</p>

<p>
The swamp was half-a-mile away, and Challis
found it necessary to walk round it for some distance
before he could get a fair shot at the birds, which
had settled down in a bed of rushes.  They
appeared to be a variety of pigeon, a delicacy which
the men would appreciate after living almost
wholly on meal.
</p>

<p>
When he had located the game, he sent his men
forward to start them.  The instant they rose in the
air he let fly with both barrels in rapid succession,
and brought down a bird with each shot.  Following
up the rest of the covey until they settled again,
he killed another brace, and so went on for nearly
an hour, until there were as many birds as the
men could carry.
</p>

<p>
His success had quite banished the misgivings
with which he had started.  Picturing the delight
of his boys at getting a whole day's good eating, he
had given the order to return, and was half-way
back to camp, when he was startled by a great
shouting and commotion from its direction.
</p>

<p>
Sprinting on at full speed, he was just in time to
see a number of his boys running across the open
space in front of the zariba, closely pursued by a
dozen horsemen.  The runners, who appeared to
be laden with bananas, darted into the enclosure
through the gap they had left in the fence; but
before they could draw the rough gate across it, the
foremost horsemen galloped through at their heels.
</p>

<p>
Challis guessed in a moment what had happened.
The men's appetite had been whetted by the report
of the nearness of a banana plantation.  They had
been too childishly impatient to await his return,
and, either with Kulana's consent or in defiance
of him, they had gone out to gather the fruit,
only to be surprised by some wandering tribe.
</p>

<p>
He rushed impetuously across the open space to
the support of his men, not staying to reflect that
he could do nothing really effective.  Besides his
shot-gun, he carried a revolver.  The horsemen had
fire-arms, which they had not used as yet, feeling
no doubt that their swords were sufficient for the
work in hand.  Some of the Hausas had rifles, but
it was clear that they were too much paralysed by
the appearance of a mounted enemy to make use of
them.  They were yelling with fright.
</p>

<p>
Before Challis was half-way to the zariba, a
second party of horsemen broke from cover in the
direction of the village, and rode straight at him.
Flinging up his shot-gun, he emptied the barrels
almost at random; then drew his revolver.  But
at that moment a shot from the pistol of one of the
galloping horsemen struck him above the wrist,
and the revolver fell to the ground.  In another
second he was spun round by the impact of a
horse's shoulder, reeled, and fell.  The horsemen
galloped over him on their way to the zariba, and
before he lost consciousness it seemed to him that
he had been kicked and trampled by a hundred
hoofs.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
UNDER THE LASH
</h3>

<p>
Challis opened dazed eyes upon a scene that
bewildered him, and for a few moments he could
not account for the pains that gripped all his limbs.
Remembrance stole back into his reviving
consciousness, and gradually he became aware of the
meaning of what he saw.
</p>

<p>
The zariba had been demolished.  At one side of
what had been his camp a number of horses were
tethered.  In the centre his Hausa boys were
busily packing the baggage, much more rapidly
than Challis had ever seen them doing it before.
The reason of their haste was easily discovered.
Over them stood a circle of negroes, who urged them
with fierce cries and drawn swords.  The camp had
fallen into the hands of an enemy.
</p>

<p>
And it was not long before Challis guessed who
this enemy was.  Only one tribe in this part of
Africa, so far as he knew, rode horses.  These men
must be Tubus from across the Yo&mdash;the ruthless
brigands who were the terror of the country.  It
could hardly be doubted that these were the men
who had raided the village, and left only too clear
proofs of their merciless ferocity.
</p>

<p>
Apparently there had been no fight at the zariba.
The Hausas, armed though they were, had
succumbed without a struggle.  The truth was that,
in disobedience to Challis's order, some of the men
had left the camp, and been pounced on suddenly
by the enemy.  As they fled back to the zariba,
their comrades dared not fire for fear of hitting
them, and the swift onset of the horsemen had made
resistance hopeless.
</p>

<p>
Aching all over, Challis struggled to his feet.
Immediately a hand was laid upon him from
behind.  He noticed that his wrist was bleeding,
and taking out his handkerchief, he began to wind
it round the wound as his captor pushed him
towards the centre of the camp.  And then from
behind the horses there came forth a huge negro,
taller than he by six or seven inches, with massive
shoulders and muscular arms.
</p>

<p>
The giant's face broke into a grin as he
approached the Englishman.  He uttered some words
which Challis did not understand, but which
seemed to have in them the ring of triumph.
</p>

<p>
"I have caught you, white face!" was what
he said.
</p>

<p>
As to the white man all negroes seem at first
alike, so to Goruba Challis at this moment appeared
to be the man with whom he had wrestled at dawn
of day.
</p>

<p>
He spoke again, addressing Challis; then,
recognising that he was not understood, he called for
one of the Hausas to come and interpret.  Kulana
came up, and keeping his eyes averted from Challis,
he translated what the big man said.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing in this country?"
</p>

<p>
Challis quickly made up his mind to give no
information, trusting that he might at least save
Royce from his own fate.  He refused to speak.
The next question puzzled him, but confirmed him
in his resolution.
</p>

<p>
"What were you doing in my fort?"
</p>

<p>
Though he made no reply, it was plain that he
showed his surprise in the expression of his face,
for Goruba looked hard at him, and seemed to be
in some puzzlement himself.  Then the negro's
harsh features darkened with anger.  He flourished
his sword.
</p>

<p>
"Dog!  This will make you speak!" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
Challis looked at him, without quailing, and did
not flinch when the sword was flashed across his
eyes.  His courage seemed to impress Goruba, who
laughed, spat on the ground, and giving an order
to his men to keep guard over the prisoner, walked
away with Kulana into the midst of the sweating
Hausas.
</p>

<p>
What he had failed to elicit from the Englishman
his threats soon extracted from the carriers.  He
learnt that there was another white man, who had
set out on the previous afternoon for a village to
the north, to buy provisions.  He chuckled on
receiving this information.  There was little doubt
what village the white man he had met in the fort
was bound for.  He chuckled again.  The white
man was no doubt on his way back to the camp.
It would not be difficult to waylay him.
</p>

<p>
The work of packing was completed.  Goruba
ordered the Hausas to mount their loads.  Their
rifles, with Challis's, were in the possession of his
men.  When all was ready, the Tubus leapt to
their saddles, and the whole party set off northwards,
Challis being tied to the saddle of one of the
horses.
</p>

<p>
Often on that march Challis's blood boiled as
he saw how his men were treated, and knew his
helplessness to defend them.  The Tubus urged
them with whips, sometimes with the points of
their swords.  The wretched Hausas, some of
whom were weak with sickness, panted along
under their loads, striving to keep pace with the
impatient horsemen.  They dared not even groan,
for a murmur brought the lash on their shoulders.
When Challis protested through Kulana, explaining
that the men were ill, Goruba only grinned and
mocked him.
</p>

<p>
By-and-by, however, it became apparent to
Goruba that the men were incapable of further
marching.  The slave-driver is usually callous
enough as to the fate of his victims; he will watch
them with unconcern growing weaker and weaker,
see them drop in their tracks, sometimes kill them
in sheer rage at their inability to keep up.  But
Goruba did not wish to lose these men.  They were
themselves valuable.  They bore valuable loads.
It would be a mistake to over-drive them.  In the
afternoon, therefore, some hours earlier than a
march is usually ended, he gave the order to halt.
The Hausas laid down their burdens, and threw
themselves on the ground in utter exhaustion.
</p>

<br />

<br />
THE PRISONER
</p>

<p>
Challis himself was in little better case.  He had
not been given a load to carry, but he had felt
himself growing weaker and weaker as the day wore
on.  Though his wound was not serious, he had
lost some blood, and was enfeebled by the shock
and the bruises he had suffered in the trampling.
When he lagged on the march, the man to whose
saddle he was fastened prodded him in the back
with the point of his spear.  His own sufferings,
and the sufferings of his men, made him realise
with new force the horrors of slave-driving, which,
in spite of all efforts to crush it, still exists in parts
of the dark continent.
</p>

<p>
It was therefore with inexpressible relief that
he welcomed the order to halt.  The place chosen
for camp was the crest of a slight undulation.
The soil was sandy, and hot from the beating of the
sun upon it all day.  There were a few scrubby
bushes dotted around, but no grass.  Nor was
there a stream in which the marchers could bathe
their burning feet.
</p>

<p>
The Tubus fetched water from a small water-hole
near by.  They made a meal of the provisions
carried in their wallets.  The Hausas consumed the
last of their food.
</p>

<p>
Challis was forced to ask permission to open
one of the tins of preserved meat which formed part
of the men's loads.  The Tubus gathered round
him, and watched with childish curiosity as he
cut the tin open.  They were mute with astonishment
when they saw what it contained.  They
hardly allowed Challis time to take from it sufficient
for his supper, before they began to quarrel about
the ownership of the tin.
</p>

<p>
Goruba, hearing the noise, came and settled the
matter by swallowing the rest of the meat in two
or three great gulps, and taking the tin as a present
for one of his wives.
</p>

<p>
Challis was too tired and weak to care what was
done.  There was no bed but the hot dry sand;
but after eating a little he stretched himself on the
spot assigned to him in the centre of the encampment,
and forgot his sufferings for a time in a
troubled sleep.
</p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
THE NORTHWARD TRAIL
</h3>

<p>
The information which the old chief had given
Royce influenced his choice of route when he started
on his return journey.
</p>

<p>
"You see, John," he said to the headman, "we
don't want to meet this Goruba again.  No doubt
he stumbled on us by accident, and we have no
reason to suppose that he has any particular spite
against white men; certainly I had done nothing
to upset him.  But as he appears to be a dangerous
character, we had better keep out of his way.
Don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Dat all same berry good, sah," said John.
</p>

<p>
"Then we won't go back by way of the fort,"
Royce pursued.  "I dare say, indeed, these men
know a nearer way to the village.  Ask them."
</p>

<p>
The carriers assured John, when he questioned
them, that they knew a much nearer way, by which
they would leave the fort a long distance on their
right.  Royce therefore left the leadership to
their headman, who carried no load, and went on
with him, slightly ahead of the rest, to keep a good
look-out in case of possible danger.
</p>

<p>
It was not until they had been marching for
an hour or more that the suspicion flashed upon him
that Goruba might have been concerned in the
raid on the ruined village.  True, John had said
that the raiders were Tubus, and Goruba was not
a Tubu, but probably, from his appearance, and
from what the chief had said, a Nubian.  But,
remembering that Rabeh, Goruba's former master,
had himself been a slave, who had gradually worked
his way up to the lordship of a considerable empire,
Royce wondered whether Goruba had raised himself
to a similar position among the Tubus.
</p>

<p>
A puzzling fact was that he had appeared at the
fort alone.  As Rabeh's lieutenant he no doubt had
made himself so much hated in this part of the
country that he could expect no mercy if he
fell into the hands of any of his former victims.
It seemed therefore unlikely that he was really
quite alone.  He must belong to a party, and what
could be more probable than that he was a member,
if not the leader, of the party who had burnt the
village?
</p>

<p>
The more he thought about it, the more troubled
Royce became.  If the raiders had not returned
to their own country across the Yo, it was at least
possible that they might discover Challis's camp.
He was uneasy at the idea of Challis, with his few
men, of whom half were sick, having to sustain
an attack by a large body of the most ferocious
warriors known in that part of Africa.  Anxious to
rejoin his friend, Royce grew impatient at the slow
pace at which the carriers walked, heavily burdened
as they were, and would have gone on far ahead
but that he felt himself responsible to the chief for
their safety.
</p>

<p>
It was fortunate that he had decided to avoid
the fort on his return journey.  Goruba had
dispatched a small band of his best men to lie in wait
there, and ambush the white man and his follower.
They were lurking in the precincts of the fort
at the very moment when Royce and his party were
making a bend to the south about a mile distant.
</p>

<p>
The route followed by the headman of the carriers
led through a considerable stretch of wooded
country.  The headman told John that he would
not have chosen that way but for his master's
desire to avoid the fort, although it was shorter.
When John asked him why, he explained that the
woodland was the resort of large herds of elephants,
of which the carriers were somewhat afraid.  It
would have been different had they not been
carrying loads.  They were bold enough when they
accompanied the chief on hunting expeditions,
and had spears in their hands.  But with heavy
loads on their heads they felt helpless if the great
beasts should chance to cross their path.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice, as they pressed on at their best
pace, they heard a great crashing among the trees.
Their scent, carried on the breeze, had disturbed
the elephants browsing in the thickets.  The
sound alarmed the men, but Royce, when John
told him what caused it, explained that the
elephants were just as anxious to avoid them as they
were to avoid the elephants.
</p>

<p>
"What the white man says may be true," said
the headman.  "But sometimes the scent of men
makes the elephants angry, and then they seek
the men, and do not run away."
</p>

<p>
They passed through the woodland without
encountering elephants, and found themselves on
the low shore of an extensive lake, the remoter
border of which was overhung by low cliffs.  The
negroes were careful to keep at a good distance from
the brink of the water.  Alligators might often
be met with on the mud flats, lying so still, and
being so much the colour of the ground, that their
presence was sometimes only known by the shrieks
of some hapless victim whom one had seized.
</p>

<p>
As they were skirting the lake, John suddenly
gave a shout, and pointed to what appeared to be
a greyish-black ridge just projecting above the
surface of the water.  This object seemed to swell,
the water was disturbed, and at one end of the ridge
emerged the ugly head of a hippopotamus.
</p>

<p>
"Hippo meat berry fine, sah!" said John longingly.
</p>

<p>
"I daresay, but I am not going to shoot when I
don't know who may be about," Royce returned.
"And don't shout again, John, whatever you may see.
I am not anxious to meet that giant Goruba again."
</p>

<p>
They left the lake behind, and by dint of hard
marching through rough and scrubby country
reached the neighbourhood of the ruined village
a little before nightfall.  Approaching it on a
different side from that by which he had left it,
Royce would not have recognised it but for the
assurance of his guides.
</p>

<p>
He hurried along with John at the head of the
party through the desolate blackened street until
he reached the palm-trees, where he expected to
find the camp.  To his surprise there was no sign
of an encampment having been there, nor, looking
round, could he discover Challis or any of the boys.
</p>

<p>
"What does this mean, John?" he asked, feeling
very uneasy.
</p>

<p>
John looked puzzled for a moment or two; then
his face lightened as the explanation struck him.
</p>

<p>
"Boys 'fraid of debbils, sah," he said.  "Massa
Chally find 'nother place."
</p>

<p>
Somewhat relieved, Royce hastened on with the
man, hoping to see his friend at no great distance.
In a few minutes they caught sight of the scattered
material of the zariba.  In the enclosure was a
round mark upon the ground, indicating where the
tent had stood, and blackened spots where the men
had kindled their fires.  But all the baggage was
gone, except one tent-peg.  There was nothing else
save a number of empty banana skins.
</p>

<p>
Royce paused in dismay.  John looked about
with the air of a man in fear.  And then there was
a sudden cry from one of the carriers, as they came
up toiling under their loads.  They halted, dropped
their burdens, and, collecting in a group, stood
staring at the ground.
</p>

<p>
Royce and John hurried to them, wondering
what had attracted their attention.  They were
looking with terror at some dull reddish splashes on
the soil.
</p>

<p>
Royce's heart sank.  It was inconceivable that
Challis had moved camp of his own accord.  He
must have been attacked.  The bloodstains seemed
to indicate that there had been a fight; yet they
were very few, and all at one spot.  He looked
about, dreading to see dead bodies in the
neighbourhood of the enclosure.  The relief he felt at
finding none was smothered by a great anxiety.  It
seemed only too certain that, fight or no fight, the
camp had been captured, and all within it carried
away.
</p>

<p>
For some little time they all stood silent.  Then
the headman suddenly started, threw up his arms,
and with a howl of fright took to his heels, and ran
fleetly back along the way he had come.  Instantly
his companions followed him; in a few seconds they
had disappeared.  Royce was left alone with John.
</p>

<p>
The Hausa had already discovered the cause of
their sudden stampede.  He had caught sight of a
black form skulking among some thin bush at no
great distance from the camp.
</p>

<p>
Just as he pointed him out to his master, looking
much inclined to bolt after the carriers, the figure
moved towards them, hastening its steps, and
revealing itself to be that of one of their own men.
The carriers, no doubt, had supposed him to be
one of the party who had rushed the camp, and
feared that the rest were somewhere near.
</p>

<p>
John ran to him, asking eagerly what had become
of Massa Chally.  The man explained that he and
another had accompanied Massa Chally when he
went shooting birds, and on their return had seen
thousands of Tubus swoop down on the camp.
Being himself somewhat in the rear of the other
two, he had concealed himself, and the birds he
carried, in the bush, and remained there until the
prisoners had been taken away.  So far as he knew,
he was the only one who had escaped.  Fearing to
leave the spot, he had waited there, knowing that
Massa Royce would return by-and-by.
</p>

<p>
"Was there a fight?" asked Royce.
</p>

<p>
The man replied that Massa Chally had fired
his gun, but was himself wounded and ridden down
by the horsemen.  No one else had fired.  Most
of the men were laden with bananas, and the
horsemen had come upon them so suddenly that there
was no time to do anything.
</p>

<p>
Bad as the news was, Royce recognised a reason
for thankfulness in that Challis had not been killed.
The carrier was firm on that point.  He had seen
the white man tied to a saddle, and taken away with
the rest.
</p>

<p>
"Which way did they go?" Royce asked.
</p>

<p>
The man pointed towards the north.
</p>

<p>
Royce stood pondering.  What was to be done?
It was unthinkable that he should leave Challis
and the faithful boys to their fate, even though by
following them up he should share it.  Challis
might escape, in which case he would need help,
and the nearer Royce was to him the better.  But
Challis was not the man to desert his negroes, and
the chance that all would be able to escape together
was slight.
</p>

<p>
The longer Royce thought over the problem, the
less likely did it appear that he could do anything
for his friend.  Yet he must make an attempt.
Were the positions reversed, he knew that Challis
would try to do something for him.
</p>

<p>
"We must go after them, John," he said at last.
</p>

<p>
"Save Massa Chally, sah&mdash;oh yes!" replied
John, trying to look cheerful.
</p>

<p>
The other man was too much terrified of solitude
to raise any objection, though he was inwardly
trembling at the thought of meeting the Tubus.
</p>

<p>
"What can we do with these provisions?" said
Royce, indicating the calabashes which the
frightened carriers had dropped.  "We ought not to
leave them for the birds; they may come in handy
some day."
</p>

<p>
John suggested that they should be carried into
the bush, and covered up as well as possible with
the material of the dismantled zariba.  This plan
seemed to be the only one possible, and the three
spent half an hour in stowing the calabashes under
a thick layer of thorn branches.
</p>

<p>
Then, providing themselves with enough food
for a couple of days, they set off on the trail of the
raiders.  There was no difficulty in following it.
The soil was sandy, and the horses had left
unmistakable traces.
</p>

<p>
"Keep your eyes open, John," said Royce.
"We must see the Tubus before they see us."
</p>

<p>
"Savvy all same, sah," said John.  "Berry
good eyes, sah&mdash;oh yes!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
THE PYTHON
</h3>

<p>
Royce and the two negroes marched steadily
on, stopping only for brief intervals of rest.  The
track led northwards towards the River Yo and
the Tubus' country beyond.
</p>

<p>
Late in the afternoon they came to a spot where
the trail forked.  It was clear that part of the
enemy's force had continued on the direct northward
course, while another part, apparently the
smaller, had diverged to the east.  It took John
only a few seconds to determine which of the two
parties included the prisoners.  Besides the hoof
marks, there were many prints of bare feet on the
soil, and among these John detected the impressions
made by Challis's boots.  These were in the direct
track going northwards.  The track diverging
to the east was made by hoofs only.
</p>

<p>
"Dem go to fort, sah&mdash;oh yes!" said John.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you think so?" Royce asked.
</p>

<p>
John grinned.
</p>

<p>
"No savvy what for," he said; "savvy all same."
</p>

<p>
Royce was aware that the fort lay eastward of
them, but he had supposed that it was rather to
the south than to the north.  Like many negroes,
John, as was afterwards proved, had almost as
keen a sense of locality as a wild animal.
</p>

<p>
"If you are right," said Royce, "some of the
men have probably ridden to the fort to waylay
us on our return.  That big fellow must be one of
the Tubus."
</p>

<p>
"Him no Tubu, sah," said John decisively.
"Big fella too much ugly."
</p>

<p>
As Royce had never seen a Tubu, this statement
conveyed nothing to him.  Goruba's countenance
was certainly of a Nubian cast.  But he felt assured
that the man had some position of authority among
the raiders, and had either sent or led a party to
attempt his capture.
</p>

<p>
He was much troubled in mind at the thought
of leaving some of the enemy in his rear.  His only
chance&mdash;a slight one at the best&mdash;of helping Challis
would be wholly destroyed if the party from the
fort came up behind him, and discovered him before
he had time to go into hiding.  There was no sign
of that party having already returned and rejoined
the main body.  The one hope he had was that the
men in ambush at the fort, after waiting there all
day, had now given up the idea of waylaying him,
and had struck into the northward route at some
point far ahead.
</p>

<p>
Less than an hour of daylight remained; it
would soon be dark, and the Tubus were not more
likely than any other native tribe to continue their
journey in darkness.  So Royce felt that if he
escaped notice until sunset he would be pretty safe
until next morning dawned.
</p>

<p>
The sun went down, and the three men halted.
</p>

<p>
"Where are we to camp, John?" asked Royce.
</p>

<p>
The Hausa looked around.  There was no shelter
anywhere on the ground, but at a little distance
from the track a solitary large tree reared itself to
a height of some fifty feet.
</p>

<p>
"Dat's him, sah!" cried the man.  "Sleep in
tree; berry nice."
</p>

<p>
"It won't be the first time," thought Royce,
remembering a certain hot afternoon years before,
when he and Challis, happy-go-lucky schoolboys,
had dozed the hours away in the fork of an elm
overlooking the cricket-field.
</p>

<p>
They sat down on the ground to eat their frugal
supper.  John was quite concerned at having
nothing better to offer his master than some
parched grain and a few nuts, and vigorously rated
the carrier for not bringing some of the birds Challis
had shot.  He wanted to kindle a fire and give the
food at least a little flavour by roasting, but Royce
would not allow it.
</p>

<p>
"We don't know how near the Tubus are,"
he said.  "They might see the flame, or smell the
smoke.  I shall do very well as it is, John."
</p>

<p>
Then they climbed the tree one after another,
Royce envying the agility with which the
barefooted negroes mounted, and selected, each for
himself, a secure perch among the branches.
</p>

<p>
The two Hausas fell asleep instantly.  Royce,
however, found his quarters very unpleasant.
They were not in the least like the cool elm he
remembered so vividly.  Mosquitoes and a thousand
other small insects buzzed about him, settling
upon face and arms, some to sting, others to bite,
until he was in torture.  He swung his arms about
to ward them off, and covered his face with his
handkerchief, tucking it under his helmet and into
the collar of his coat.  But the terrible pests defied
all his efforts to protect himself, and he gave up
at last, resigning himself to endure their torments
with what patience he was master of.
</p>

<p>
It was some time, too, before he lost his fear of
toppling from his swaying perch and crashing to
the ground.  The effort to secure himself made his
limbs stiff and cramped, and he looked forward to
a night of sleeplessness and pain.  But sleep crept
upon him unawares.  He fell into a doze, uneasy
indeed, and fitful, but yet giving blessed intervals of
oblivion.
</p>

<p>
From one of these spells of slumber, Royce
suddenly started to wakefulness and a strange
feeling of terror.  He had not been dreaming;
by this time he was so much accustomed to the
stings of the insects as to be almost unconscious of
them.  Yet he was bathed in sweat, and felt as
though some fearful doom were hanging over him.
He lay panting in the crook of the branches.
</p>

<p>
What was this strange, musty odour of which
he was now aware?  What was the cause of the
dreadful feeling of sickness that chilled his skin?
Unable to account for his wretched state, he lay
still, hoping that the feeling would pass.
</p>

<p>
The foliage rustled above and around him;
insects hummed; in the distance he heard the
wailing call of some strange night bird, the booming
note of a giant frog, the bark of a beast of prey.
In these there was nothing alarming.  But his
uneasiness, the sense of impending danger, grew
upon him, and at last, unable to endure the
mysterious feeling any longer, he was on the point of
awakening John, for the mere relief and pleasure
of hearing a human voice, when all at once the
other man, farther from him, uttered a shriek of
mortal terror.
</p>

IN THE PYTHON'S TOILS
</p>

<p>
The effect upon Royce was as startling as the
shock from an electric current.  He started up,
almost losing his balance.  The cry had this good
result, that it enabled him to shake off the numbing
horror that had oppressed him.  Groping in his
pocket, he drew out a small electric torch which he
used but sparingly, because of the impossibility of
re-charging it.  With the other hand he seized his
revolver.
</p>

<p>
A flash of the torch made all terribly clear.  The
hapless carrier was in the toils of an immense snake.
John crouched near him, paralysed with horror.
The snake was gradually tightening its hold, and
its hideous head was swaying within a few feet of
its victim.
</p>

<p>
Royce snapped his revolver at the reptile's head.
The shot went wide.  He fired again.  This time
his aim was true.  For a moment the snake
convulsively tightened its coils about the inert black
body, causing the man to groan under the crushing
pressure.  Then the coils relaxed, the head drooped,
and in a few moments the monster dropped with a
thud upon the ground.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
SETTING A TRAP
</h3>

<p>
There was no more sleep for any of the three
that night.  Royce's nerves were on edge; the
negroes, though they recovered sooner than he
from the shock, remained in a high state of
excitement.  John related a dismal story of the
absorption of a cousin of his by a snake, showing such a
relish for gruesome details that Royce ordered him
to choose another subject.
</p>

<p>
With the earliest glimmer of dawn they descended
from their perches.  At the foot of the tree lay an
unusually large specimen of the African python,
measuring at least eighteen feet.  Royce shuddered
at the thought of the fate which the Hausa had so
narrowly escaped.
</p>

<p>
They made the best breakfast they could, and as
soon as it was light enough to mark the trail, they
set off again in the track of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Royce knew that, lightly burdened as he and his
companions were, their speed was likely to be much
greater than that of the raiders, whose pace must
be regulated by the men carrying heavy loads.
So he was not surprised, after marching only two
or three hours, to reach the spot where the party
had encamped during the night.
</p>

<p>
From the aspect of the place, and the still warm
embers of fires, John guessed that the camp had
been broken up rather later in the morning than
usual, and not very long before his arrival.  This
conclusion led him to press on with redoubled
vigour, and at the same time with caution.
</p>

<p>
Royce asked himself more than once what he
would do when he came up with the raiders.  Always
he had to admit that he did not know.  It was
hopeless to attempt to form a plan.  Indeed, he
acknowledged to himself that the whole enterprise
was pretty hopeless.  The hoof marks and the
prints of feet were so numerous that the party must
be a large one.  The Hausa had spoken of thousands
of Tubus.  That was no doubt an exaggeration;
the negro is always ready to magnify numbers;
but it was almost certain that the horsemen
mustered a score or two.  What was more surprising
was the character of the footprints.  Royce's
full party consisted of only sixteen carriers, of
whom two were now with him; but the depth of
the impressions on the sandy soil, rather than their
number, indicated that there were many more
than fourteen prisoners.  African natives march
nearly always in single file, each man stepping in
the tracks of the man in front of him; the
footprints now before him were so deeply impressed
that they must have been made by a large number
of men.
</p>

<p>
Of the three trackers, John went first, as the most
experienced in travelling over this kind of country.
Every now and again he would point to the marks
of Challis's boots, when they were clearly
distinguishable from the other prints.  Presently he
declared that Massa Chally must be tied to a horse,
for his footprints corresponded regularly with the
marks of four hoofs.
</p>

<p>
Towards midday the track struck into a well-beaten
native path, on which the foot-prints were
less clearly marked.  It ran northward over
undulating wooded country, broken now and then by
open spaces of prairie-like land.  John declared
that there were signs of their approaching a river.
</p>

<p>
When they came to the open spaces, he slackened
pace, and scouted forward with great caution, to
make sure of not stumbling upon the rear of the
enemy.  It was very unlikely that these had any
idea of being pursued, but they were in hostile
country, the people in the far-distant villages were
their bitter foes, and they would hardly neglect
the usual precautions against surprise or sudden
attack.
</p>

<p>
From one of these spaces, to which John had
gone on ahead, he ran back by-and-by, his eyes lit
with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"See horses, sah!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Going from us?" asked Royce anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Tails dis way, sah."
</p>

<p>
"Lead on slowly.  Be sure to keep out of sight."
</p>

<p>
Since the horses were moving, clearly the only
thing to be done was to keep in touch with them
for the present, and seek a favourable opportunity
of ascertaining the exact strength of the party and
their order of march.
</p>

<p>
As a precaution against being discovered, Royce
suggested that they should leave the path, and
pursue their course at some little distance on one
side of it or the other.  John agreed that this was
wise, though it would retard their progress.  This,
however, mattered little, seeing that they were
travelling considerably faster than the raiders were.
</p>

<p>
A little later, Royce himself, on ascending a
slight eminence, caught sight of the horsemen.
</p>

<p>
The size of the party surprised him.  At the rear
were about a dozen mounted men, more or less
clothed, turbaned and armed; the sunlight flashed
on their weapons, though at the distance he could
not yet discover what those weapons were.  Beyond
them, strung out in a long line that wound
like a snake over the country, was a body of more
than a hundred negroes on foot, with mounted men
among them at intervals.  At some distance ahead
was another party of armed horsemen, larger than
the one in the rear.
</p>

<p>
To determine their numbers exactly was
impossible.  Royce wished he had thought of taking
his field-glasses with him when he left the camp a
few nights before; they were now, he feared, among
the captured baggage, but at a rough estimate he
felt sure that there could not be fewer than forty
mounted men, in charge of perhaps a hundred
and twenty captives.  It was clear that the Tubus
had raided several small villages, and that Challis
and the Hausas were the latest additions to their
haul.  No doubt they were now making for their
own district across the Yo, in high spirits at the
successful results of their expedition.
</p>

<p>
Only a few minutes after Royce caught sight of
them, the straggling column came to a halt.  It
was the time for their midday meal.
</p>

<p>
"Eat now, sah?" asked John.
</p>

<p>
"You can go on a bit longer?" said Royce.
</p>

<p>
"Can do same as Massa," John replied.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then.  I suppose they will rest for
a couple of hours or more.  That gives us a chance
of getting ahead of them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, sah.  Get ahead, sure 'nuff."
</p>

<p>
John regarded the suggestion as one that would
merely score a point in the game.  Royce, however,
had a serious object in view.  The size of
the party had made clear what he had all along
suspected: that direct intervention on his part
was impossible.  What could a little band of three,
of whom only two were armed, do against so
formidable a force?
</p>

<p>
When two combatants are unequally matched,
the weaker tries to accomplish by guile what he
cannot do by strength.  Royce was wondering
whether, by slipping past the raiders, and examining
the country in front, he could discover a spot
where by some trick or ambuscade he might throw
them into confusion, and rescue Challis before they
had recovered from their surprise.  He had no
definite plan in mind; everything depended upon
the nature of the ground.
</p>

<p>
Increasing their distance from the path, the
three marched rapidly through a belt of thin
woodland which screened them sufficiently, and came
back to the track, after a long round, at a point
which Royce calculated to be a good mile ahead
of the raiders.
</p>

<p>
They pressed on, avoiding the path, on which
Royce's boots would have left tell-tale tracks, but
keeping as near to it as was safe.  John halted
every now and then to look back, and to listen for
sounds of the enemy's advance.  Royce gave his
whole attention to the features of the surrounding
country.
</p>

<p>
As they covered mile after mile without finding
a spot where anything in the nature of an ambush
could be successfully attempted, Royce's hopes
sank lower and lower.  The country became more
and more hilly, and the path followed the undulations
in almost a straight line over bare soil.  It
did not pass through tracts of thick bush or clumps
of woodland, which might have afforded opportunities
for an ambuscade.  Nor were there abrupt
corners or overhanging banks that would have lent
themselves to the springing of a surprise on the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
The Hausas wondered why their master kept on
marching so doggedly, now that they were miles
ahead.
</p>

<p>
"Eat now, sah?" said John at last.
</p>

<p>
"You can eat as you walk, if you like," replied
Royce, "but we won't rest yet."
</p>

<p>
Some little while later, as they were rounding the
shoulder of a low hill, John suddenly cried:
</p>

<p>
"Ribber, sah!  Savvy ribber here all same."
</p>

<p>
"I can't see it," said Royce.
</p>

<p>
This answer appeared to tickle John, who laughed
heartily.
</p>

<p>
"See him bimeby," he said.  "Hear him now."
</p>

<p>
And then Royce caught a faint sound like the
rustle of leaves in the wind.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes' walking proved that John was
right.  The track made a sharp bend.  On the
left of it the ground fell away steeply to a river
valley, down which a stream was tumbling rapidly,
no doubt to join the Yo somewhere to the east.
</p>

<p>
Royce's drooping spirits took a joyous leap, for
the path led down to a frail swinging bridge which
spanned the stream.  It was made of plant rope,
and looked too slight to bear the weight of more
than a few men at a time.  The possibilities of the
situation flashed upon his mind.
</p>

<p>
It was clear that the stream was not fordable
at this spot, otherwise there would be no bridge.
The African native never puts himself to unnecessary
trouble.  It was equally clear that the bridge
was not strong enough to bear the weight of horses;
therefore the mounted men would not cross here,
but must go either to the right or to the left to
seek a ford.  Best of all, on the side of the track
remote from the stream, the ground rose so steeply
as to form almost a precipice.  Here, if anywhere,
an attempt to throw the party into confusion might
succeed, and the idea of a plan to do even more
than that had already suggested itself to Royce.
</p>

<p>
Would he be able to carry it out?  Success
depended on many conditions&mdash;the arrangements
of the raiders, the nerve and quickness of his own
men, a hundred and one chances.  At any rate, it
was worth attempting.
</p>

<p>
"Gambaru," he said to the second Hausa,
"climb up to the top there, and watch for the
enemy.  Lie down behind a bush, so that they will
not see you.  When you are sure what they are
going to do, slide down and tell me.  John, come
down to the river with me."
</p>

<p>
On reaching the bridge, Royce first ran across it
to test its strength, then took out his pocket-knife,
and cut as many of the plant ropes as he dared
without bringing the whole structure down.  John
looked on in amazement.
</p>

<p>
The bridge took off from a low cliff on either side
of the stream.  The banks were overgrown with
thick tall bushes and reeds.
</p>

<p>
"You can hide there?" said Royce, pointing to
the vegetation beneath the nearer end of the bridge.
</p>

<p>
"Hide plenty all same, sah," replied John,
looking puzzled and a little uneasy.
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  We'll go back now, and wait for
Gambaru's report.  Then I'll tell you what to do."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
THE BROKEN BRIDGE
</h3>

<p>
On returning from the bridge, Royce was too
impatient to remain at the river level and wait for
news from Gambaru, perched on the heights above.
He reflected, too, that when so much was at stake,
it was better to make his own observations than
to rely on an unskilled native.
</p>

<p>
"Gambaru's eyesight is no doubt better than
mine," he thought, "but his judgment is not likely
to be.  And I've had some training in scouting."
</p>

<p>
He clambered up the steep acclivity until,
somewhat out of breath, he reached Gambaru's side.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen anything?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nuffin, sah," the man replied.
</p>

<p>
Shading his eyes from the sun, Royce gazed
earnestly over the country.  He could see the track
for nearly a mile, until it disappeared below the
shoulder of the hill a few hundred yards from where
he stood.  There was no human being in sight.
</p>

<p>
Again and again he looked, becoming more and
more restless at the non-appearance of the enemy.
He began to fear that they had diverged from the
track, and instead of directing their march towards
the bridge, had made off in a body towards a ford.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly Gambaru touched his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Dat's dem, sah!" he cried, extending his arm.
For a few moments Royce's less perfect vision
failed to descry anything upon the track except
what seemed to be a slight haze.  But at length
he was able to distinguish figures, and then he felt
considerable surprise.  The men he saw marching
towards him were all on foot.  Where were the
horsemen whom he had previously seen at the head
of the column?
</p>

<p>
"What uncommon luck!" he said to himself.
"They seem to have left the track already, and
gone to one side or the other to cross by some ford
they know.  It makes things easier."
</p>

<p>
He had expected the mounted men to accompany
the column to the bridge, and then part from it to
find the ford.  That they had not done so proved,
first that they were very confident, and secondly
that the ford was at some considerable distance from
the bridge.
</p>

<p>
The Tubus clearly expected no molestation by
natives of the district, whom they, no doubt,
regarded as completely cowed.  It was equally clear
that they intended, after making their detour by
the ford, to meet the rest of the column at some
spot beyond the bridge.
</p>

<p>
Taking care to keep under cover, Royce watched
the procession until the last man appeared.  All
the horsemen had gone.  He made out that there
was a vanguard of about half a dozen armed men,
and another half a dozen brought up the rear.  At
intervals along the column there were about the
same number, acting as escort to the prisoners.
The vanguard marched some two hundred yards
ahead of the rest, who were strung out over at least
half a mile.  They marched very slowly.
</p>

<p>
It was a long time before Royce was able to
distinguish the figure of his friend.  He almost
feared that Challis had been taken to the ford, still
tied to the saddle; and it gave him a thrill of joy
when at last he observed the white-clad form, about
half-way down the column.
</p>

<p>
Royce had already conceived the general idea
of his ambuscade; the absence of the horsemen
promised to make its working out in detail much
easier than he could have hoped.  These details he
thought out as he watched the column slowly
advancing.
</p>

<p>
His plan was to let the vanguard pass over the
bridge, then to sever them from the rest of the
column by cutting the remainder of the ropes, and
afterwards to deal with the others as circumstances
might dictate.  It was this last part which had
given him most anxiety.  Now, however, he rapidly
made up his mind to attempt an operation which
had been suggested by the nature of the ground.
</p>

<p>
The track, it will be remembered, made a sharp
bend just where it descended to the river.  On one
side was the river itself, thickly fringed with rushes;
on the other, the steep and almost precipitous slope.
It depended on the nerve and the quickness of
Gambaru whether he could take advantage of that
bend to carry out his scheme.
</p>

<p>
He rapidly explained to the man what was
required of him, and was delighted to find how
quickly it was understood, and how eager the
Hausa was to assist him.  Then they slid down
the slope, and while Gambaru hid amid the rushes
near the bend, Royce hurried to John, waiting
beneath the bridge.
</p>

<p>
"Six or seven Tubus will come on to the bridge,"
he said.  "When they have just passed the middle,
but before any of them have got to the other side,
cut all the ropes I have left uncut.  You understand?"
</p>

<p>
"Savvy all same, sah," said John, his eyes
gleaming, his lips parted in a wide grin.  "Dey go
plop!"
</p>

<p>
"Then run back as fast as you can and join me.
There will be other work for you."
</p>

<p>
He hastened back to the bend, and concealed
himself by Gambaru's side among the rushes.
</p>

<p>
It was perhaps five minutes later that the first
man of the advance guard appeared round the bend.
He walked straight down to the bridge-head,
followed by five others.  Royce watched them eagerly,
his heart beating fast.  Everything depended on
what would happen in the next minute.
</p>

<p>
To his dismay, instead of walking at once on to
the bridge, they stood in a group at the end, all
talking together.  Were they going to wait until
the prisoners came down?  If they did, it would
spoil everything.
</p>

<p>
For half a minute Royce waited in a fever of
suspense.  Then, to his great joy, the men formed
single file again and began to cross the bridge.
</p>

<p>
Now he had a new anxiety&mdash;the fear that John
would not act quickly enough.  But the first of the
Tubus was still some yards from the farther bank
when there was a slight swishing sound, a tremendous
splash, and a babel of yells from the men whom
the cutting of the ropes had plunged into the river.
</p>

<p>
Then John, drenched with water, but beaming
with delight, came rushing up to join his master,
who, with Gambaru, had left his hiding-place and
stationed himself at the near side of the bend.
</p>

<p>
As Royce had expected, the shouts of the men
had the effect of bringing up the nearest man of
the escort at the double, leaving the group of
prisoners, of which he was in charge, to follow.
The moment he showed himself round the corner
Royce dealt him a blow that stretched him on
the ground.  Gambaru, acting on Royce's instructions,
instantly pounced on the man, tore the turban
from his head, and calling to John to assist him,
stuffed into his mouth a gag made of the linen, and
pinioned his arms with strips shred from his loincloth.
</p>

<p>
Royce, meanwhile, stood waiting for the next
man, at the same time watching with some anxiety
the operations of his Hausas.  All, perhaps,
depended on their quickness.  His anxiety was
needless.  With ready wit John perceived the nature
of his master's design, and within twenty seconds
the fallen Tubu was helpless and harmless.
</p>

<br />
COLLAPSE
</p>

<p>
A few moments later a second Tubu dashed
round the bend.  Like the first, he had left his
gang of prisoners, and run ahead to discover the
cause of the outcry, which had now ceased, for the
men of the advance guard had been carried far
down the rapid stream.
</p>

<p>
The second man was served as the first had been.
A third and a fourth appeared, only to meet the
same fate.  Then there was a pause.  Either the
remaining members of the escort had not heard
their comrades' yells, or the ensuing silence had
reassured them.
</p>

<p>
Three-parts of the column of captives had
meanwhile been left unguarded.  But the wretched
creatures marched slowly on.  Roped together,
men and women, with their captors before and
behind, they did not dream of attempting to escape.
They were too weary and listless to feel any
curiosity about the brief noise ahead of them.
There was nothing to flash a gleam of hope into
their dejected minds.
</p>

<p>
The first gang of them, a full score in number,
dragged their tired feet round the bend.  Their
heads were downcast, but a sudden exclamation
from John caused some of them to look up in
startled surprise.  Among them were Kulana and
three others of Royce's carriers.
</p>

<p>
John instantly slit the rope that fastened the
first couple by the neck, and, passing along the
line, set the prisoners free one after another.
Dejection gave way to joy, silence to shouts and
laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Take those rifles and spears," said Royce to
his men, pointing to the weapons of the Tubus who
had been laid low.  "Kulana, tell these prisoners
to stand aside by the river bank and keep quiet."
</p>

<p>
All this had been done out of sight of the rest of
the column.  In a few minutes the second gang
came up.  These were liberated like the first; there
were three more of Royce's Hausas among them.
</p>

<p>
Again there was an interval; then the third gang
appeared, and Royce thrilled with delight when
he saw Challis among them.
</p>

<p>
"Here I am, old man," he called.
</p>

<p>
Challis smiled feebly, and Royce was shocked
to see the change in his friend.  His cheeks were
pale and haggard, his eyes sunken and unnaturally
bright; his figure shrunken and bent.
</p>

<p>
"I'm nearly done for," he murmured, as Royce
released him.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old chap!  But we'll soon have you right
again.  Just rest here until we have finished our
job.  John, get some water for Massa Chally."
</p>

<p>
He supported Challis to the foot of the grassy
slope, and settled him comfortably there.  Then he
returned to the bend.
</p>

<p>
In due order the rest of the prisoners came along,
with the last two members of the escort.  When
these had been dealt with, only the six men of the
rearguard remained to be disposed of.
</p>

<p>
Wishing to avoid a fight, Royce considered how
to complete his work.  There would not be time to
disarm each of the men in turn as they came round
the bend.  An idea occurred to him.  He ordered
the whole party of released prisoners to dispose
themselves amid the tall rushes along the river
bank, and the Hausas to carry down the fallen
Tubus.  He himself assisted Challis to reach a place
of concealment.  Thus, when the rearguard rounded
the bend, there was no one in sight along the open
path.
</p>

<p>
The Tubus halted in amazement when their eyes
fell on the broken bridge.  They looked this way
and that in search of the prisoners, and Royce,
watching them through the rushes, feared that
they might turn tail and retreat.  But after a few
minutes they hastened forward, scanning the farther
bank to see if by some unknown means the prisoners
had been able to cross the river.
</p>

<p>
When they had almost reached the bridge-head,
Royce stepped quickly from his hiding-place with
the armed Hausas, and ordered John to call to the
Tubus.  At the shout they swung round, and saw
facing them a white man and seven Hausas covering
them with rifles.
</p>

<p>
John called to them to surrender and throw down
their arms.  For a moment they hesitated; then,
recognising that between the rifles and the river
there was no escape, they cast their own weapons
on the ground and made signs of submission.
</p>

<p>
At Royce's instruction John ordered them to
move away along the bank of the river.  Then six
of the Hausas advanced, took their rifles, and
returned.  And then the whole band of liberated
prisoners sprang up from among the rushes, and
the place rang with their shouts of delight.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
IN HOT PURSUIT
</h3>

<p>
"Now for the next move," said Royce to Challis.
"Feel better, old man?"
</p>

<p>
"Much!  It's so good to see you again.  But
I'm fairly crocked."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that.  You'll be all right after a
rest.  We mustn't lose any time, though.  Can
you tell me how far back the horsemen left you?"
</p>

<p>
"Two or three miles, I think.  They went off
to the left; of course I didn't know why, though I
see now."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there are about thirty of them, aren't
there?  They have probably crossed the river by
this time, higher up, and are waiting somewhere
ahead.  We can't tell how long they will wait
before they become uneasy, but no doubt when
they do they will ride to the bridge.  Finding it
broken down, they will probably think that the
whole party is making for the ford, and will very
likely ride back and round to meet them.  That
ought to give us several hours."
</p>

<p>
"Little enough if they discover what has really
happened."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; they've a great advantage of us in their
horses.  There's only one thing to be done.  With
only fourteen rifles we can't fight them.  We must
get back as quickly as we can.  What luck to
recover all our baggage!"
</p>

<p>
"There's food, too; not very much, certainly,
which shows that the Tubus aren't far from their
own grounds."
</p>

<p>
"True, and their tribe may number hundreds
for all we know.  It's a ticklish position for us.
But we concealed near your camp the food we
brought with us.  We must all get back as quickly
as possible and secure that.  I only hope that we
shan't be pursued, for we should stand no chance
at all against mounted men."
</p>

<p>
Royce wasted no time.  First of all he had the
six men of the rearguard tied up like their comrades
and laid at the edge of the rushes, where they
would be discovered by their friends when they
returned to the bridge.
</p>

<p>
Then he selected four of the Hausas to carry
Challis on a litter made of their rifles.  Soon the
whole party was marching back along the track,
John leading with six of the men armed with rifles,
Royce bringing up the rear with the remainder.
</p>

<p>
There was a remarkable change in the demeanour
of the negroes.  Whereas before they had marched
slowly, listlessly, they now stepped out with
buoyant vigour.  Freedom gave them new strength.
The loads had been distributed among them, so
that each man's burden was light; and they pressed
on untiringly, only eager to get back to their homes.
</p>

<p>
Again and again Royce looked back anxiously
along the track.  There was no sign of pursuit.
Without halting a moment the party marched on
until nightfall, and then encamped, worn out, but
happy, for they were pretty sure that no attack
would be made on them during the dark hours.
Nevertheless, Royce arranged for the guarding of
the camp through the night by the Hausas in turn.
</p>

<p>
He exchanged notes with Challis about all that
had happened since they parted.
</p>

<p>
"I've one hope," he said.  "It is that the
Tubus, knowing they have white men to deal with,
will not molest us further.  They have experience
of what white men can do, because their lands are
on French territory."
</p>

<p>
"But the French have little control over them,
judging by their raids," replied Challis.  "I fear
we can't reckon on being left alone.  They will be
enraged at the loss of a fine haul of slaves, and the
men we left tied up will tell them that there are
only two of us.  Besides, that man you call Goruba
has a score against you.  It is clear to me now that
at first he mistook me for you."
</p>

<p>
"The whole thing is sickening," said Royce.
"It looks as though our prospecting for tin is at
an end.  We can't proceed with hostile savages
hovering about us.  But we've much to be thankful
for."
</p>

<p>
As soon as it was light they broke up camp and
resumed the march.  The long rest had greatly
benefited Challis, whom, however, Royce would
not allow to walk.
</p>

<p>
The condition of some of his men made Royce
anxious; but the negro has great endurance, and
the hope of reaching safety helped the men to
keep up.
</p>

<p>
There was still no sign of pursuit, and Royce
grew more and more cheerful as time went on.  In
the afternoon the party arrived at Challis's
dismantled camp.  In order to prevent a raid upon
the provisions, Royce had ordered John and
Gambaru not to mention where they were hidden.
On reaching the spot, he led the main body of the
prisoners some little distance beyond, and
commanded them to rest on the ground until food was
brought to them.
</p>

<p>
The calabashes were found just as John had left
them.  Food was served out to the whole party&mdash;sparingly,
for it was impossible to tell when another
supply could be obtained.
</p>

<p>
During the meal, Royce discussed the position
with Challis.  They decided to give the prisoners
the opportunity of returning to their homes.  When
it was put to the poor negroes, most of them,
including all the women, set off at once in different
directions.  But a group of the men hung back.
</p>

<p>
"Dey want to stay with Massa," John explained.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want them.  We shall have to go
back to the coast."
</p>

<p>
"Dat make um berry jolly, sah," said John.
"Houses burnt; no place can go; dey like berry
much go with Massa."
</p>

<p>
"What do you say to that, Tom?" Royce asked
of Challis.
</p>

<p>
"They had much better stay in their own
country.  But I suppose we can hardly turn the
poor fellows away.  Let them come; I daresay
they'll be tired of it long before we reach Akassa."
</p>

<p>
"We'll start in about an hour, then&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Unless what?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, the idea of chucking things up when
we've come so many hundreds of miles makes me
sick.  I was wondering whether after all we
couldn't make our way into French territory, and
persuade the authorities to back us up."
</p>

<p>
Before Challis could reply, there came a shout
from Gambaru, who had been stationed to keep
watch.
</p>

<p>
"What does he say, John?" asked Royce.
</p>

<p>
"Him see horses, sah."
</p>

<p>
Royce sprang up, and ran to a stretch of rising
ground from which the country northward was
visible for some miles.  One glance was enough.
The negro horsemen were in pursuit.
</p>

<p>
Stooping so as to be as little visible as possible,
Royce doubled back.  It was clear that to march
southward with a mounted enemy on their heels
would be to court destruction.  To take refuge in
the bush or the woodland would merely postpone
the disaster for a short time.  What could be done?
</p>

<p>
An idea flashed into his mind.  Was there time
to reach the fort in which John and he had spent
that unforgettable night?  All depended on the
number of the horsemen he had just seen.  If they
were the men who had forded the river,
unreinforced, there was a bare chance.
</p>

<p>
By the time he regained the camp Royce had
made up his mind.
</p>

<p>
"John, tell these men to carry the food and
baggage into the forest yonder," he said.  "You
must lead them.  We will make for the fort.  Give
Mr. Challis your rifle."
</p>

<p>
It was some minutes before the released prisoners,
laden with their bundles, had got under way.
Meanwhile, Royce drew up the Hausas in line,
and, facing towards the oncoming horsemen, moved
backward slowly towards the forest.
</p>

<p>
The carriers had not yet gained the shelter of the
trees when the Tubus, some thirty in number,
broke from cover and charged down upon the little
party.  Royce was at one end of the line, Challis
at the other.
</p>

<p>
"Don't fire until I give the word," said Royce.
</p>

<p>
The horsemen rode on with shrill yells, firing as
they came.  But their aim was wild, and no one
was hit.  Slowly withdrawing, Royce kept his eye
fixed on them, whispering:
</p>

<p>
"Steady!  Steady!  Wait for the word."
</p>

<p>
The Hausas were panting with excitement, but
not a man of them lifted his rifle.  At last, when
the horsemen were little more than two hundred
yards away, Royce dropped on his knee.
</p>

<p>
"Now, boys!" he said.
</p>

<p>
Following his example, the Hausas fired.  It
was a somewhat ragged volley, but at the short
range almost every shot told.  Many saddles were
emptied; some of the enemy drew rein; others
galloped on, to be met by a second volley, which
completely broke the charge.  The survivors
wheeled their horses and dashed madly back
towards the bushes from behind which they had
emerged.
</p>

<p>
"Now, boys, with me!" cried Royce.
</p>

<p>
He led them at the double across the open space
into the belt of woodland which John with his
party had already entered.  His stand had given
them a respite, but there could be little doubt that
this troop of the enemy was merely an advance
guard, for Goruba was not among them.  Everything
now depended on whether the fort could be
reached before Goruba came up with a much
larger force.
</p>

<p>
"Step out as quickly as possible, boys," said
Royce.  "Their horses won't be much good to
them if we get into the fort.  You have done well."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
A STRATEGIC RETREAT
</h3>

<p>
John, the headman, was very intelligent.  His
sense of locality and direction appeared to be good.
But Royce felt a little anxious about his ability to
act as guide in their march towards the fort.  The
man had only visited it once.  Hurrying to the
head of the column, he said:
</p>

<p>
"You are quite sure you can find the way?"
</p>

<p>
"Nebber lose it, sah!" replied John, with a
gurgling laugh at his own simple joke.  "Savvy
way all same quite correct."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Remember that we all depend on
you.  You will save time by getting some of these
new men to take turns with our boys in carrying
the stuff.  I leave you to arrange that."
</p>

<p>
The party now consisted of more than forty men.
John went ahead with two or three of his original
gang and the released prisoners, who numbered
over a score.  Some distance in the rear came
Royce and Challis with the rest of their boys,
armed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a little doubtful whether we are doing the
right thing," Royce remarked to his companion.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Challis.
</p>

<p>
"Because I'm out of my element.  I don't know
in the least how these Tubus are likely to act.  If
they were a civilised enemy, I should be sure that
the check we have just inflicted would not choke
off the pursuit.  In that case we should be doing
the right thing&mdash;the only thing, in fact, to avoid
extermination."
</p>

<p>
"You mean that if we have choked them off,
we ought to be hurrying away to the south?"
</p>

<p>
"That's it.  My experience in field days with
the Scouts and the O.T.C. doesn't help much now."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so sure of that," said Challis.  "I
think you have done jolly well so far."
</p>

<p>
"Well, looking at matters from the worst point
of view, and assuming that the Tubus will still
come after us, I don't see that we could do better
than we are doing.  The difficulty is this: if we
get into the fort, we escape immediate destruction,
but we are in no position to stand a siege.  Our
ammunition will hold out a good while, but our
food won't."
</p>

<p>
"Still, we shall gain a little time.  Perhaps they
won't pursue us farther.  If they do, they may
sheer off when they find us behind defences.  Let
us hope for the best."
</p>

<p>
They were marching through thin forest on more
or less undulating ground.  In some places, while
the trees and bush offered few obstacles to men
marching on foot, they would considerably impede
horsemen.  In others, the country was so open
that mounted men would gain on them.
</p>

<p>
Whenever they passed over stretches of open
ground, they would halt for a few minutes, and
scan the country behind for signs of the enemy.
It was on such clear spaces that most was to be
feared.
</p>

<p>
In the forest land the party had a certain
advantage over mounted pursuers.  They could avail
themselves of cover far more effectually than was
possible for horsemen.  They could move nearly
as fast, and more safely and secretly.  A tree or a
bush that would conceal a man on foot might give
little cover to a horse and its rider.
</p>

<p>
They had marched for two or three hours, and
had just halted on the brink of a stream for rest
and refreshment, when Royce, mounting to the
crest of a low hillock, caught sight of three or four
horsemen amid the scrub far in their rear, on the
other side of the stream.
</p>

<p>
He watched them anxiously, hoping that they
were not the forerunners of a more numerous body.
In a few minutes his worst anticipations were
confirmed.  At a little distance behind the small
group of horsemen stretched a long column, vastly
more numerous than the band whom he had
checked and put to flight.  There could be no
doubt that a large force of Tubus was in hot
pursuit.
</p>

<p>
With a quick eye Royce examined the ground,
calculating the chances of making a stand.  The
hillock was covered with brushwood that gave
excellent cover; the enemy, on the other hand,
before they could reach the stream, must pass over
a wide space of almost open land.
</p>

<p>
They had evidently descried the fugitives.
Royce felt very uneasy as he caught fleeting
glimpses of horsemen moving among the tall grass
for some distance up and down stream.  It was
clear that they were taking advantage of their
superior numbers to try to outflank him.  There
was no time to be lost if a successful resistance were
to be made.
</p>

<p>
He shouted to Challis to bring all the men from
the low ground up the hillock.
</p>

<p>
"We must try to make a stand here," he said.
"If we go on we are bound to be ridden down."
</p>

<p>
He placed the unarmed men well to the rear,
and posted the others in a crescent line behind the
scrub on the crest of the hillock, facing the enemy.
</p>

<p>
"Lie flat on your faces," he said, "and fire when
I give the word."
</p>

<p>
The Tubus had been advancing in column at a
trot, but within a few hundred yards of the hillock
they opened out into line, and came on at a gallop
with fierce cries.  In the centre was a gigantic
negro whom Royce recognised as Goruba.
</p>

<p>
The Hausas kept absolute silence, awaiting their
leader's command.  It came when the Tubus were
no more than two hundred yards distant.  The
rifles flashed; several of the horsemen fell; some
halted behind the largest bushes near to them;
others turned and galloped to the shelter of a
clump of trees.
</p>

<p>
Royce rose on his knees, and peering over the
brushwood, anxiously scanned the farther bank up
and down stream.  In both directions the flanking
movement was continuing, and what was more
serious, in response to a mighty shout from Goruba,
whose tall form could be seen threading its way
between the bushes in the distance, the Tubus
dismounted, and tethering their horses, began to
work their way forward on foot.
</p>

<p>
Royce tried to pick off the leader, who was
clearly something of a strategist.  But the negro
took such skilful advantage of the bushes that
Royce was never able to get a clear shot at him.
</p>

<p>
His intention was obvious.  It was to hold the
party in front, while his men crept round on each
flank, and enveloped them.
</p>

<p>
"We run the risk of being surrounded," Royce
called to Challis at the other end of the line;
"there's nothing for it but to retreat."
</p>

<p>
To retreat, even with a disciplined force, is, as
Royce knew, one of the most hazardous operations
of warfare.  The risks were tenfold with his Hausas,
none of whom had served in the West African
Rifles, who have become such excellent soldiers
under the training of their British officers.  But
they were a compact little band, all devoted to
him, and he decided to take the risk.
</p>

<p>
First sending word to the unarmed men to make
all speed to the rear with their loads, he divided
his little force into two parties.
</p>

<p>
"You see that ridge yonder?" he said to Challis,
pointing to a bush-covered position some distance
away.  "Fall back to that slowly with your lot.
I'll join you as soon as I can."
</p>

<p>
Challis set off.  Meanwhile Royce retained his
position, and kept up a steady fire on the enemy
as they advanced, creeping on yard by yard under
cover of the bushes.
</p>

<p>
"Whenever you see a man, shoot!" said Royce
to the Hausas.  "Don't shoot without marking
your man."
</p>

<p>
The Tubus made no use of their firearms.  Royce
and his men were hidden from them by the brushwood,
and they did not waste their shots on an
enemy whom they could not see.  No doubt, Royce
reflected, this was a mode of warfare to which they
were unaccustomed.  They were used to carry all
before them in a dashing charge, and he wondered
at their persistence under the new conditions.
</p>

<p>
Presently a shrill whistle from the rear
announced that Challis had taken up his position on
the ridge.  The space between was a long undulation,
only a few yards of which, at the rearward
end, were in view of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
"Now, boys, run!" said Royce.
</p>

<p>
Heading his men, he sprinted down the incline,
rushed up the farther acclivity, and dashed past
Challis and his party, calling to Challis to hold the
Tubus until he had gained a new position still
farther to the rear.
</p>

<p>
He noticed a clump of trees a little to the right,
nearer the bank of the river, and made straight
for that.  As he ran towards it, he came within
view of the horsemen working round on the left
flank.  They immediately wheeled round, and
galloped hard in pursuit.
</p>

<p>
But their course brought them below the ridge
on which, all unknown to them, Challis and his
band lay concealed.  As they rode past, within
range of about a hundred yards, a sudden volley
on their right flank sent some of them reeling to
the ground.  The rest, taken all aback, swerved
to the left, and dashed frantically away towards
their main body, who had now become aware that
the hillock was deserted, and were surging up it.
</p>

<p>
"Well done, Tom!"
</p>

<p>
The ringing words came faintly from the rear.
Challis brushed his sleeve across his sweating brow,
and ordered his men to run with him.
</p>

<p>
It was something to have gained half-an-hour
without the loss of a man.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
A STAMPEDE
</h3>

<p>
Taking advantage of the flight of the flanking
party, Royce pushed on as soon as he was rejoined
by Challis, in order to gain a denser portion of the
forest, where the pursuers would be much more
impeded than his own men.
</p>

<p>
He had two other reasons.  The carriers had
gone on by themselves, without guidance, and it
was probable that they would take a wrong direction.
Further, there was a possibility that in the
absence of the white men they would be seized
with panic, and stampede, leaving their loads.  The
Hausas could not at once carry and fight, and all
the fighting strength would be needed if the enemy
still came on.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that the double check which the Tubus
had suffered had daunted them, at any rate for the
time being; for Royce, looking back, saw no sign
of their having crossed the ridge.
</p>

<p>
About ten minutes later he came up with the
carriers, who, on reaching the edge of the thicker
woodland, had prudently halted from fear of losing
the way.  John again went ahead with them as
guide, Challis following at a short interval with his
section, and Royce with the remainder acting as
rearguard.
</p>

<p>
The march through the forest entailed a
disadvantage which almost outweighed its advantages
from the point of view of security.  It was
impossible to see what the enemy were doing.  They
might have given up the chase; they might be
pressing on in the rear; they might still be working
round on the flanks, avoiding the woodland area,
and outspeeding the fugitives on more open ground.
</p>

<p>
For this reason Royce forced the pace as much
as possible.  From his rather hazy recollection the
fort was still five or six miles away, a distance which
he could scarcely hope to cover under three hours.
</p>

<p>
By degrees the forest thinned, and after about
two hours' marching it opened upon the lake which
Royce had skirted on his return from the village.
By this time everybody was tired and hungry.
</p>

<p>
"We must take a spell of rest," he said to Challis.
"I think it's scarcely likely the Tubus have come
through the forest after us."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad enough," replied Challis.  "A little
more of this, and I shall crock up again."
</p>

<p>
"Poor old chap!  We must avoid that.  It's
certainly hard on you after what you've gone
through.  Down loads, John.  Serve out a meal.
The boys can drink from the lake; but let them
beware of crocodiles."
</p>

<p>
"A thing has occurred to me," said Challis, as
he sat with Royce waiting until John had roasted
some nuts for them.  "Will Goruba suspect that
we are making for the fort, and get there first?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so.  He is more likely to suppose
that we are returning to the village where we got
our supplies.  This is the direct route towards it;
the fort lies more to the left."
</p>

<p>
"That relieves my mind.  But it's a pity we
can't tell what the enemy are doing."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go reconnoitring presently.  The fort can't
be more than a mile or two away, and as it stands
on an eminence it ought to be visible from the cliff
over there."
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the high ground which bordered
one side of the lake.
</p>

<p>
"I'm inclined to think they have given it up,"
he continued.  "Negroes aren't very persevering
as a rule, and they've had enough to damp their
spirits.  It would be absurd to look for the same
persistence in them that you would expect in a
civilised and disciplined enemy....  Well, John,"
he added, as the Hausa came up with some roasted
nuts spread on broad leaves, "is this the best you
can do for us?"
</p>

<p>
"Not good dinner all same, sah," said John,
with a rueful look.  "Get rabbit some day."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there's plenty of game about the fort,
isn't there?  Which is lucky for us, considering
that we have so many more mouths to feed."
</p>

<p>
Poor as the fare was, they ate it with a good
appetite.  Then Royce rose.
</p>

<p>
"I'll come with you," said Challis.  "I'm curious
to take a look at this fort of yours."
</p>

<p>
"Come along, then.  It's only about two hundred
yards to the top of the cliff.  John will give us
warning if anything happens."
</p>

<p>
Taking their rifles they set off, walking round the
margin of the lake.  On their left stretched an
open grassy space, beyond which was the forest
from which they had lately emerged.
</p>

<p>
The ground rose gradually.  They were halfway
up the ascent to the cliff when Royce stopped
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth's that?" he said.
</p>

<p>
They halted, puzzled to account for a strange
noise which seemed to proceed from the forest
on their left.  At first a dull rumble, it grew in a
few seconds to a succession of heavy thuds, becoming
louder moment by moment, and mingled with
sharp cracks like pistol shots.
</p>

<p>
"It can't be the Tubus charging through the
trees," said Challis.
</p>

<p>
A shout from behind caused them to turn their
heads.  The men had leapt to their feet, and were
standing in a huddled group, with every sign of
fear.  One, a young negro from among the released
prisoners, was sprinting towards them at full
speed.
</p>

<p>
"We had better go back," said Royce, "or
they'll get into a panic.  The row is terrific.  A
thousand cavalry couldn't make such an uproar....
Great Scott!"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-099.jpg" alt="AT THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF" />
<br />
AT THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
</p>

<p>
Through the leafy screen of the forest a hundred
yards away there had emerged a large elephant,
plunging forward at a lumbering gallop with trunk
uplifted.  In another fraction of a second the whole
of the light timber and brushwood at the edge of
the forest appeared to dissolve, and a wild mob
of scores of elephants burst like an enormous
breaker upon the open space.
</p>

<p>
Petrified for a moment with amazement, the
two Englishmen became suddenly alive to their
peril.  Whether they went on in the direction
intended, or returned to their men, they would
equally cut across the front of this stampeding
herd and must be overwhelmed.
</p>

<p>
"Straight for the edge of the cliff!" cried
Royce.
</p>

<p>
They dropped their rifles and dashed to the
right.  It was forty or fifty yards to the edge of
the cliff; the elephants were already only about
half that distance behind them, gaining moment
by moment.  The ground shook under the tremendous
charge of the maddened beasts.  To the
fleeing men it seemed that the breath from the
gaping mouths scorched them.
</p>

<p>
A small spur of the cliff jutted to the left.  The
runners swung round on to this and without a
moments' pause took a header into the lake twenty
feet below.
</p>

<p>
When they came up to the surface they had to
fight for breath in a cauldron of broken water.
They were both good swimmers, or they would
never have survived the sort of Niagara swirl in
which they were now hurled about and buffeted.
</p>

<p>
Only their instinctive leap to the left before they
made the dive had saved them from destruction.
It had prevented the elephants from falling on
top of them, for some of the great beasts, charging
straight ahead in a blind fury, had plunged
headlong over the brink into the lake.
</p>

<p>
The turmoil of the water soon subsided, and the
swimmers, on regaining the use of their faculties,
found themselves in the company of the scattered
herd, all swimming in search of a landing-place.
</p>

<p>
In a few moments Royce caught at a branch of
an overhanging tree, and both he and Challis drew
themselves up among the foliage, and watched the
ungainly animals swim by.
</p>

<p>
"Hope it's cooled their rage," said Royce in
gasps.  "We've had a narrow squeak."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed!  Under several tons of elephant
flesh we should have been pretty well flattened
out.  What made them stampede, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"Our scent, perhaps.  I hope they weren't
started by the Tubus."
</p>

<p>
"We had better get back.  It will be rather a
feat to climb the cliff, by the look of it."
</p>

<p>
They crept along the tree to the place where it
sprang from the cliff, then clambered up the steep
face with the aid of straggling plants and knobby
projections.
</p>

<p>
When their heads appeared over the edge, there
were loud shouts of joy, and John came rushing
up at the head of the whole party of negroes.
</p>

<p>
"Fink you gone dead, sah," he said, his broad
face beaming.  "All alive and safe and sound, and
always merry and bright.  Yoi-aloo!  Hurray!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we're all right," said Royce.  "Is that
my rifle?"
</p>

<p>
"All gone smash, sah," returned John, lifting
the rifle which he had picked up from the ground.
"Massa Chally's all right, sah."
</p>

<p>
The lock and barrel of Royce's rifle had been
smashed beyond repair by the ponderous hoofs.
Challis's was unbroken.
</p>

<p>
"Tibu, sah&mdash;where he go?" asked John, as
they marched down to their camping place.
</p>

<p>
"Who's Tibu?"
</p>

<p>
John explained that when the startling sounds
came from the forest, Tibu, one of the released
negroes, had recognised them at once as made by
stampeding elephants, and had run up the cliff
to warn the Englishmen.
</p>

<p>
"Of course; I saw him just before we ran," said
Challis.  "Let us turn back and look for him."
</p>

<p>
But though they spent some time in searching
the cliff above and below, they found no trace of
Tibu.  He was never seen again.  It could only
be surmised that, like the Englishmen, he had fled
towards the edge of the cliff, but, less lucky than
they, had fallen into the water directly beneath
the elephants, and been crushed to death.
</p>

<p>
Only a few of the elephants had plunged into
the lake.  The majority had skirted it and
disappeared into the woodland beyond.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
A NARROW SHAVE
</h3>

<p>
"John, send a man to fetch Kulana," said
Royce.  "It is time we were off."
</p>

<p>
Before the Hausa dispatched by John had gone
out of sight, he met Kulana hurrying back from
the northward post to which he had been sent to
watch the progress of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Kulana reported that a small party of Tubus
had caught sight of him as they emerged from a
clump of trees some distance away.  They had
pursued him and almost run him down when the
rush of stampeding elephants caused them to wheel
their horses and flee for their lives.  He himself
only escaped being trampled to death by taking
shelter behind a large tree, where he had remained
until the storm swept by.
</p>

<p>
Learning from John that the course taken by
the elephants was almost the direction of the fort,
Royce had an idea.
</p>

<p>
"Why not follow in the track of the elephants?"
he said to Challis.  "They will clear the Tubus off
our line of march, at least for a time, and if we
march rapidly we may get through before they
have rallied."
</p>

<p>
"We can try, but I doubt it," replied Challis.
"The elephants are going at such a thundering
speed that they are miles away by this time, and
the Tubus won't have any reason to be afraid of
them.  Still, there's nothing else to be done, and
we had better start at once."
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes the baggage was loaded on to
the released prisoners, and the party set off, John
leading the way with Royce and half the Hausas,
the carriers following, and Challis with the rest of
the armed men bringing up the rear.
</p>

<p>
There was no difficulty in following the track of
the elephants.  It was as though a tornado had
swept over the country.  A path several yards wide
had been cut through the scrub and the thin forest.
Tall grass and shrubs had been crushed flat, saplings
broken off like matchwood.  Only large trees had
survived the rush, and the ground was strewn with
the lower branches of these.
</p>

<p>
Royce went a good distance ahead of the carriers.
They marched as quickly as possible, but, laden as
they were, their pace did not exceed the rate of
two and a half miles an hour.  If the fort, as Royce
believed, were still about five miles away, he could
not but confess to himself that Challis's doubt was
justified.  He repressed his anxiety and impatience,
keeping as careful a lookout as the nature of the
country permitted.
</p>

<p>
When they had followed the track for a little
more than a mile, John caught sight of an object
in the distance that caused him to halt.  At first
he was unable to determine what the object was,
but when Royce persuaded him to advance a few
paces he declared excitedly that it was a fallen
horse.
</p>

<p>
Royce ordered his men to extend and scout
carefully forward.  Coming presently to the horse he
saw that it was dead, and beyond it, hitherto hidden
from sight, lay a dead negro, his body terribly
crushed.
</p>

<p>
What had happened was clear.  The hapless
rider had been caught by the elephants, and
overthrown before he could extricate himself from the
undergrowth.  With a shudder Royce passed on.
</p>

<p>
Some little distance farther on John halted again.
</p>

<p>
"What is it now?" asked Royce, whom the
slow progress was making more and more uneasy.
</p>

<p>
"No go fort way, sah," replied the man.  "Fort
dat way, elephants go dis."
</p>

<p>
He pointed first straight ahead through the
forest, then to the right, the direction in which
the elephants had rushed.  It was clear from the
marks of devastation that the beasts had not yet
checked their furious pace.  Royce wondered what
had caused a panic which was so persistent.
</p>

<p>
"We had better go after the elephants," he said
after a few moments' consideration.  "It is out
of our way, you say, but it will be at any rate clear
of Tubus."
</p>

<p>
Accordingly they struck off to the right.  The
forest here was somewhat denser, and though the
small trees and undergrowth had been pretty well
levelled by the elephants' ponderous bodies, the
tangle made marching very difficult.  Royce halted
several times in order that he might not altogether
lose touch with the carriers behind.
</p>

<p>
After another half-hour's tramp the course of
the elephants took another turn to the right.
</p>

<p>
"We simply daren't follow it any longer," said
Royce, mopping his wet brow.  "It will take us
much too far out of our way.  In fact, I daresay
you have lost your way already."
</p>

<p>
John did not repeat his little joke.  His downcast
expression indicated plainly enough that he was
now at fault.  He glanced up at the sun through
the over-arching trees, and at last hesitatingly
suggested a direction in which they might proceed.
</p>

<p>
"Unless you have been quite wrong all along,
we can't be very far from the fort now," said Royce.
"But as we couldn't see it for the trees we might
go right past it without knowing.  Perhaps the
country opens out, however, so let us try it."
</p>

<p>
Leaving the track they plunged through the
forest, dodging the thorns and forcing their way
through the entanglements of undergrowth and
creepers.  It was very hot work, and Royce felt
as tired as if he had marched twenty miles on end.
</p>

<p>
After a quarter of an hours' toilsome progress
they came suddenly to the edge of the forest; and
there, almost straight ahead, less than a mile away,
they saw the fort, a brown, sunlit patch on the
hillock.
</p>

<p>
"Savvy all same, sah," cried John in delight.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you are either very clever or very lucky,"
said Royce.  "I hope our troubles are now over
for a time.  We must wait here, just within the
forest line, until the others come up."
</p>

<p>
He leant against a tree, looking out over the
space of rolling country between him and his goal.
It was open save for scrub; there was no sign of
man or beast.
</p>

<p>
But he had waited only a few minutes when two
negro horsemen came out from behind a distant
clump of trees, crossed the open space, and
disappeared to the westward.
</p>

<p>
Royce's anxiety returned with doubled force.
It was almost certain that these Tubus had been
lurking on the watch in the neighbourhood of the
fort.  They might indeed have been sent ahead by
Goruba to ascertain whether the fort was yet
occupied.  In all probability a larger party of their
people was not far away.
</p>

<p>
It seemed hours before the carriers came up.
Challis was close behind them with his party.
</p>

<p>
"Thank goodness!" exclaimed Royce.  "There's
the fort, as you see.  But we must let the men
rest awhile, and then make a dash for it."
</p>

<p>
"Why not go straight on?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw two Tubus cross yonder.  If we're to
get there safely we must put on our best speed;
we can't go at this terrible dawdle&mdash;less than two
miles an hour lately."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure we had better go on.  If the men
drop their loads they will become noisy, and the
Tubus may hear them.  Let's take the bull by the
horns, old man."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then.  We must keep close together;
it would be fatal to get scattered.  But we'll go
in the same order.  John, tell the carriers they
must move quickly and silently.  Now, are you
ready?"
</p>

<p>
He led the way from the forest into the scrub,
the rest of the party forming a compact column
behind him.  Keeping an eye fixed on the clump
behind which the Tubus had disappeared, he made
straight for the fort.
</p>

<p>
As yard after yard of the ground was covered,
he became more and more hopeful of gaining the
shelter of the walls unmolested.  But when the
party was within less than half a mile of their goal
there were shouts in the distance.  Immediately
afterwards, from the forest on the left, a cloud of
horsemen dashed out and galloped straight towards
them.  At the same time a smaller party, farther
ahead, rode diagonally across the open ground to
cut them off.
</p>

<p>
It was a critical moment.  There was just time,
Royce thought, to reach the small belt of woodland
below the hillock.  Calling on the carriers to hurry,
he placed the Hausas to guard their flank.
</p>

<p>
"Tell the men to go straight up to the fort,"
he said to John, adding to Challis: "We must
try to keep the enemy off until the men are
safe."
</p>

<p>
Spurred on by fear, the carriers quickened their
pace.  The Tubus, uttering fierce yells, dashed on,
firing their guns aimlessly.  Tense with anxiety,
Royce measured with his eye the distances between
his party, the woodland, and the horsemen, and it
was with a gasp of relief that he gained the trees
while the Tubus were still a hundred yards away.
</p>

<p>
The two bands of horsemen closed in, and rode
towards the woodland.  At the edge of the belt
Royce had drawn up his little party of riflemen.
They fired two volleys in quick succession at the
charging crowd.  Remembering what they had
suffered in the previous attacks, the Tubus, seeing
several of their numbers fall, checked their horses
and withdrew a short distance.
</p>

<p>
"Goruba isn't with them," said Royce.
</p>

<p>
But at that moment the tall negro came galloping
from the rear, and, brandishing a huge scimitar,
began to harangue his hesitating men.
</p>

<p>
"Come!" said Royce quietly.
</p>

<p>
Without waiting to see the inevitable result of
Goruba's furious words, he withdrew his men
quickly through the wood, splashed through the
little stream that bathed the foot of the hillock,
and climbed up to the fort.  The carriers had
already disappeared within the walls.
</p>

<p>
"Only by the skin of our teeth!" panted Challis,
as he stumbled into the entrance.
</p>

<p>
"And this is only the beginning of things!"
returned Royce.  "What is to follow?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
AT BAY
</h3>

<p>
Tired out by their long march on insufficient
food, the men were in no condition to withstand
a determined attack; and Royce felt that all was
lost if Goruba pushed on at once at the head of his
men.
</p>

<p>
But apparently Goruba had no such intention.
He led his men, indeed, almost to the base of the
hillock; but then, discovering that the retiring
party had entered the fort, he swung round to the
left, rode along the bank of the stream, and
disappeared among the trees a quarter of a mile away.
</p>

<p>
"That gives us a breathing space," said Royce.
"It won't last long.  If Goruba was savage at
finding me alone here, he will be still more enraged
now.  Besides, he can't afford to own himself
beaten.  If the natives in the district were to
learn that the dreaded Tubus are not invincible,
his prestige would be gone.  You may be sure that
he is determined to destroy us."
</p>

<p>
"This place is half in ruins," said Challis, who
had thrown himself down, and looked pale and
worn.  "If he came on in earnest, we should be
wiped out.  He must have three or four hundred
men with him."
</p>

<p>
"It's clear that he has learnt respect for our
rifles.  And he needn't hurry.  All he has to do
is to invest us, and in a short time he can starve
us out.  Our food won't last more than about ten
or twelve days, however economical we are.  I
see John is getting a meal ready.  When the men
have had a feed and a rest, we had better set
some of them to strengthen our defences."
</p>

<p>
"It's very lucky that we have got our camp
equipment."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I only wish we had a few more spades.
We must build up an earthwork where the walls
are broken down, and with only three spades it
will take a long time."
</p>

<p>
"And the Tubus can snipe the men as they work."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think they will do much damage.
Their weapons appear to be poor, and they are
certainly not good shots....  I'm sorry I led you
into this mess, Tom."
</p>

<p>
"Tosh!  I'm glad.  I've had a very easy, comfortable
life up to the present, and I'm inclined to
think too much comfort is bad for one.  Hardship
and danger test a man, and it's up to us to show
that we've something of the old British spirit left."
</p>

<p>
Here John came up with some tinned meat on
an enamelled plate and a few biscuits.
</p>

<p>
"Boys want water, sah," he said.  "Very dry."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps there is a well in the place," Challis
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go and see," said Royce.  "Stay where
you are&mdash;you need rest more than I do."
</p>

<p>
In a courtyard in the centre of the fort he
discovered a well, but it was filled up with rubbish.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing for it but to go down to the
stream," he said, returning to Challis.
</p>

<p>
"A risky job, in full view of the Tubus," his
friend answered.
</p>

<p>
"We must chance that.  Without water we
can't hold out a day.  If only two or three creep
down on the north side they may escape notice.
All the Tubus appear to be on the south."
</p>

<p>
"We two had better do it, with John."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it!  John shall go, and Gambaru;
but only one of us.  It won't do for both to risk
being potted."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll go," said Challis.  "You are the
boss; besides, you're a better shot than I."
</p>

<p>
"But, hang it, man! you've already been
wounded, and I'm without a scratch.  Your job
is to get perfectly fit again in the shortest possible
time.  John, go and collect all the things that will
hold water.  There's our collapsible pail; you can
take a meat tin or two.  Hunt about the place on
the chance of finding something else."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Hugh," said Challis, rising, "I
insist on taking a hand."
</p>

<p>
"Rot, I tell you!  If I'm boss, you'll have to
obey orders."
</p>

<p>
"I won't!"
</p>

<p>
"Mutiny, by Jove!  This won't do, Tom.  To
settle matters without squabbling, we'll toss for it.
Heads, I go; tails, you."
</p>

<p>
He spun a coin.
</p>

<p>
"Tails!" cried Challis.
</p>

<p>
"Done you!  It's heads," said Royce lifting his
hand.
</p>

<p>
"I might have known it&mdash;you always win the
toss," Challis grumbled.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I was born lucky," said Royce equably.
"But you shan't be unemployed.  Keep an eye
lifting; if you see any attempt to interfere with us,
you know what you must do."
</p>

<p>
John meanwhile had collected all the vessels
of any size that would hold water.  In addition
to the collapsible pail, he had two empty meat tins
which he had connected by a cord.  In one of the
rooms of the fort he had found a few earthenware
pots, some broken and useless, one perfect, two or
three with the handles chipped off.
</p>

<p>
"A rather miscellaneous lot," said Royce, viewing
the collection.  "But they'll do.  Just sling a
cord round the necks of those that have lost their
handles, John.  We'll take two apiece.  They'll
hold enough for the present."
</p>

<p>
Their preparations were soon completed.  Royce
carried the pail and the two meat tins; each of the
Hausas had two earthen vessels hanging by a cord
over his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Royce led the way through the building to the
dilapidated wall on the north side.
</p>

<p>
"Take a good look round," he said to John.
"Do you see any of the Tubus?"
</p>

<p>
John scanned the prospect from left to right.
Far to the left was a patch of woodland; then a
stretch of open country dotted with bushes,
extending to another clump of trees almost in their front.
To the right of this the ground was again open,
up to the forest from which they had recently
emerged.
</p>

<p>
"No Tubus, sah," said John.  "Dey all plenty
afraid."
</p>

<p>
"I hope they are.  Now then, down to the
stream with me.  It will only take ten minutes
there and back."
</p>

<p>
They climbed over the broken wall, and ran down
the hill, making use of the sparse bushes for cover.
Meanwhile Challis, unknown to Royce, had brought
all the rest of the Hausas except one to the north
side, and posted them there with their rifles.  The
last man he had left at the south side to keep a
watch on the clump of trees behind which the
Tubus had withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
Royce had gone three parts of the way down the
hill when there was a shout in the distance, followed
by a shot.  He glanced ahead quickly, but none of
the enemy was to be seen.  A little patch of smoke
hung over the trees about a quarter of a mile
beyond the stream.
</p>

<p>
"They mean to surround us, then," he thought.
</p>

<p>
He quickened his pace, dodging from bush to
bush, and calling to the Hausas to hurry, taking all
possible cover.  Since the enemy had not yet come
out into the open, there might be time to fill the
vessels and return before there was any serious
danger.
</p>

<p>
The three men dashed down to the stream, dipped
their vessels, and in less than half a minute turned
back to ascend the hill.  Another shot rang out,
and from the wall above a volley flashed.
</p>

<p>
"Good man!" thought Royce.
</p>

<p>
Then he became aware that one of the meat tins
was leaking badly.  By the time he reached the
fort all the water it contained would have run away.
</p>

<p>
"Botheration!" he said to himself, quite
forgetting his danger in the annoyance caused by
this discovery.
</p>

<p>
But a moment later he knew that the danger
was even greater than he had supposed.  From
his left came a din of lusty shouting.  He heard
a single rifle-shot, farther away than the volley
which had just been fired.  The meaning of it
flashed upon him.  The main body of the Tubus,
warned by the shout and the shots, had left the
position to which they had retired, and were dashing
across the open to attack the fort on the south
side.
</p>

<p>
Behind him, too, the enemy was coming on.
Looking over his shoulder, he saw that a small
band of horsemen has issued from the wood and
were galloping towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, boys!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
But the weight of the vessels and the awkwardness
of carrying them caused them to make slow progress
up the hill.  Shots began to fly around them.  There
were answering volleys from the wall of the fort,
but Royce knew by the sound that some of the men
who had fired before had been recalled to defend
the south side.
</p>

<p>
With the Hausas he staggered on, panting for
breath.  It seemed a miracle that he had not yet
been hit.  If the Tubus had dismounted and taken
aim, not one of the three would have been left alive.
But, true to their fighting method, they fired
recklessly as they rode, no doubt hoping to ride the
fugitives down.
</p>

<p>
At his right hand Royce heard a crash.  A
bullet had struck one of the earthen vessels carried
by John.  It was shattered.  The loss of weight
released the pot at the other end of the cord, and
this, too, fell to the ground and was shivered to
fragments.
</p>

<p>
Next moment Gambaru, who was a few paces
ahead of Royce, staggered and fell.  A yell of
triumph rang out behind, and the Tubus rode
through the stream and dashed up the hill in pursuit
undaunted by the shots of the diminished band at
the wall.
</p>

<p>
Gambaru did not rise.  John, after his vessels
had been broken, had run on, and was now almost
at the wall.  Royce did not hesitate.  Water was
precious, but more precious was the life of a man.
Setting down the pail and the tins, he ran to
Gambaru, stooped over him, and, discovering that he
was wounded in one of his legs, helped him to rise,
and assisted him to limp up the hill.
</p>

<p>
During these few moments the enemy, though
the pace of their horses was checked by the incline,
had rapidly diminished the gap between them and
their expected victims.  They had ceased to fire.
It was only a question of seconds and the white
man would be a prisoner in their hands.
</p>

<p>
But Royce was warned by their exultant shouts
Glancing for a moment behind, he saw a dozen
ferocious negroes within twenty yards of him.
</p>

<p>
"Crawl up!" he said to Gambaru.
</p>

<p>
Then, drawing his revolver, he turned to face
the enemy.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
THE PROBLEM
</h3>

<p>
When Royce turned to face the enemy, the
foremost of them was only twenty yards away,
urging his horse up the slope.  Behind him two
score of his comrades were riding up, in no sort of
order.
</p>

<p>
Royce was conscious of hearing shots from behind,
and of seeing two or three of the negroes reel from
their saddles.  Then the firing ceased, and at the
same time all the Tubus leapt from their horses,
and, while some held the animals, the others
rushed onward on foot.  They had perceived that
on horseback they presented larger targets to the
riflemen behind the wall.  These latter could no
longer fire, because Royce was now directly in
line between them and the enemy.
</p>

<br />
FACING THE FOE
</p>

<p>
Steadily awaiting their onset, Royce refrained
from firing until the first man was no more than a
dozen yards distant.  Then he fired three shots in
rapid succession, bringing down a man with each.
But the rest did not quail.  With strident yells
they pressed about him, trusting in their numbers.
</p>

<p>
It was a desperate situation.  Royce had only
three more shots in his revolver, and he hesitated
to expend his last available resources.  The Tubus
had few firearms, but their spears were even more
formidable weapons, and against these he had no
defence.  He fired for the fourth time, and a fourth
victim fell.  Then a spear pierced his left shoulder,
and he only escaped the point of another by pistolling
the negro as he was in the act of thrusting.
</p>

<p>
He was about to fire his last shot, feeling that
in another moment the end would come, when he
heard, half unconsciously, a fierce shout behind
him, and became the centre of a wild scrimmage.
John, who had almost reached the wall of the fort,
had turned, and, seeing his master's plight, had
charged down the hill, knife in hand, into the thick
of the crowd.  He was a big man, and the impact
of his weight overthrew two of the enemy, who
staggered against their comrades, and relieved the
pressure on Royce.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-121"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-121.jpg" alt="JOHN TO THE RESCUE" />
<br />
JOHN TO THE RESCUE
</p>

<p>
Seizing that brief moment, Royce snatched a
spear from the hand of one of the stumbling negroes,
and stood beside the faithful Hausa.  But the odds
were overwhelmingly against them.  John's sudden
onset had created only a momentary diversion.
The whole crowd of Tubus were flinging themselves
upon the two men, when there was a second and a
louder shout.  A dozen stalwarts, headed by Challis
hurled themselves into the <i>mêlée</i> and laid about
them lustily with clubbed rifles.
</p>

<p>
For a few instants the Tubus strove with fierce
courage to stem this tempestuous assault.  Then
they gave way, turned about, and rushed down the
hill towards their horses, grouped at the base.
Challis and his men took a heavy toll as they swept
along.  The men holding the horses were seized
with fright, and soon there was a wild stampede
back to the shelter of the wood.
</p>

<p>
Challis was careful not to press the pursuit too
far.  Before the enemy had time to rally, he led
his men up the hill and assisted Royce to gain the
wall.  John carried the pail of water, which was
the only one of their vessels they brought safely
home.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, old man," said Royce, when Challis
returned to him.  "It was a very near thing."
</p>

<p>
"It's better to be born lucky than rich, they say,"
said Challis; "and certainly it was a great piece
of luck that I was able to intervene at the critical
moment.  I had taken half the men to the other
side, to repel what seemed to be an attack there;
but the Tubus evidently assumed that their friends
had a good thing on this side, for they swerved to
the right.  Look, they have just joined the others
in the wood."
</p>

<p>
"They have more bravery than generalship,
that's clear," said Royce.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there are enough of them to crush us to
nothing, if they were properly led."
</p>

<p>
"There are more of them than ever.  Other
parties must have joined them.  The odds are
desperate.  We are only two score, all told, and
less than half have rifles."
</p>

<p>
"We have the walls, at any rate.  The most
necessary thing is to strengthen those as well as
we can."
</p>

<p>
"I must attend to your arm first," said Challis.
"You can't any longer say that you haven't a
scratch."
</p>

<p>
"It's not much more," said Royce, looking at his
sleeve as Challis gently drew his coat off.
</p>

<p>
"More than you think.  It's a nasty gash.
Thank goodness we've got our medical stores safe."
</p>

<p>
He dressed the wound, and bound it up with
lint; gave the same attention to Gambaru; then,
placing a man on guard at each end of the fort, they
sat down to discuss their position more fully.
</p>

<p>
It seemed likely that by diligent work they
could strengthen their defences considerably.  But
for the difficulty as to water, provisions, and
ammunition, they might hope to tire the enemy out,
if he remained persistent.  The difficulty was a
very grave one.  The water in the pail gave them
only about a cupful each, and a second attempt to
fetch more from the stream might be disastrous.
Their provisions, on half rations, might last a
fortnight; and, with the enemy so near, there was
little chance of replenishing the larder.  The
ammunition amounted to about three hundred
rounds per rifle&mdash;scarcely more than enough for
one day's hard fighting.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder whether they will stick to it," said
Challis.  "What can their object be?"
</p>

<p>
"Hardly booty," replied Royce.  "They know
very well what our possessions are&mdash;certainly not
worth heavy losses in acquiring them.  It must be
a question of prestige; they're afraid all their
victims will rise against them if they fail here.
What do you say, John?  Why don't these Tubus
let us alone?"
</p>

<p>
John scratched his close-clipped woolly poll and
looked worried.  Then he suddenly brightened.
</p>

<p>
"Dey bad plenty wicked fellas, all same," he
said, with the air of one who has solved a knotty
problem.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, that would account for anything,"
said Royce with a smile.  "At any rate, I can
think of no other explanation than the one I have
suggested."
</p>

<p>
"You may be right," said Challis; "but I can't
help thinking there is some other reason which we
know nothing about.  Time will show, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
As after events proved, Challis's guess was nearer
the truth than his friend's.
</p>

<p>
During the remainder of the day there was no
further attack, and Royce took advantage of the
enemy's inactivity to carry out his idea of
strengthening the defences.  He set all the men
except those on sentry duty to fill up the gaps in
the broken walls, partly with earth, partly with
fragments of brick and stone from the interior
of the building.  Fortunately, the bastions at the
four corners of the fort were in good preservation,
being constructed of stone.  These would prove
useful for enfilading fire, if the enemy should make
a really determined assault.
</p>

<p>
At nightfall it occurred to Challis that they might
make another attempt to get water.
</p>

<p>
"We could steal down in the dark without being
seen," he said.  "Besides, I've read somewhere
that the negro races don't care about fighting by
night.  They're as much afraid of the dark as any
little nervous kid&mdash;as I used to be myself ages
ago."
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean it!" said Royce chaffingly.
</p>

<p>
"It's true, though.  I used to lie awake for hours,
fancying all sorts of hideous creatures were floating
about the room, and cowering under the bedclothes
in sheer terror.  So much so that they gave me a
light at last&mdash;and then it was worse!"
</p>

<p>
"How was that?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, they gave me one of those wretched little
paraffin lamps with a very small round wick, and
it used to smoke horribly and fill the room, and
the smell and stuffiness caused the most dreadful
nightmares&mdash;at least, that's what my mother said."
</p>

<p>
"More likely they were due to heavy suppers."
</p>

<p>
"We are safe here on that score, at any
rate! ... Well, the negroes, being afraid to move in
the dark, are not likely to molest us; so I vote we
try for water to-night."
</p>

<p>
"John must collect some more pots, then, if
he can.  We'll have a shot at it."
</p>

<p>
Challis's confidence was borne out by the event.
In company with John and Kulana, he stole down
to the stream twice in succession, and they brought
back enough water to last three or four days.
Royce kept watch at the wall, and the water-carriers
moved so quietly that, the night being
pitch dark, he was unable either to see or to hear
them beyond twenty paces.
</p>

<p>
The night was quite undisturbed, and every
member of the party except the Englishmen had
several hours of continuous sleep.  Royce and
Challis had agreed to take each two spells of sleep
and two of watching, alternately; but Royce was
kept wakeful by the pain of his wound, though he
never let Challis know it.
</p>

<p>
When morning dawned, they looked out eagerly
over the country, in hope that the enemy had gone
away.  For some little time it appeared that this
was the case.  Not a glimpse of the turbaned
warriors was caught.  But presently John's lynx
eyes detected a movement among the distant trees
which he declared was too violent to be caused by
small animals, and too gentle to be caused by
elephants; and a few minutes later the whinny of
a horse proved his sagacity.  The enemy had not
retired.
</p>

<p>
But it became apparent that, whatever their
motive might be, they were determined to press
the siege.  Taught by experience to respect the
rifles of the garrison and the fearlessness of the
white men, they did not venture on to the more or
less open sides of the hill.  But they could be seen
working round the fort under cover of the woodland
and the Englishmen came to the conclusion that
they had formed three camps, each about six
hundred yards from the walls and about twice
that distance from each other.
</p>

<p>
That a watch was continually kept on the fort
from these camps was clear from an occasional shot
fired as a party of the enemy passed over the
intervening spaces.
</p>

<p>
"It pleases them, I suppose, and doesn't hurt
us," said Royce.  "A negro with a gun in his hand
must let it off, usefully or not."
</p>

<p>
"But they mean a serious investment," said
Challis gravely.  "They intend to reduce us by
hunger and thirst."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
A NIGHT INTRUDER
</h3>

<p>
"We must tackle the problem in bits," said
Royce.  "Take the ammunition question first;
I'll give orders that the men are never to fire except
at the word of command&mdash;yours or mine."
</p>

<p>
"The water supply is really the most urgent
matter," returned Challis.  "The Tubus are sure
to discover our night sallies by and by, and then
they'll no longer be safe.  What about clearing
out the well?"
</p>

<p>
"A good idea.  We'll set about that as soon as
possible.  Then the food; that's only next in
importance.  It depends on the enemy's patience.
If they are in no hurry, they can starve us out
without incurring any loss by direct assault."
</p>

<p>
"And I see no chance of foraging, still less of
getting any help.  It's not a cheerful prospect."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we must put the best face on it.  Our
Hausas are jolly good, and they trust us
completely.  We must keep up their pecker at all
costs."
</p>

<p>
With considerable labour they managed to clear
the rubbish with which the well was choked.  The
soil beneath it was dry, but on digging farther they
struck the underground spring which had originally
supplied the well.
</p>

<p>
"That's first-rate!" cried Royce.  "There's one
part of our problem solved.  We'll make an
embankment, to keep the water within bounds, and
have no further anxiety on that score."
</p>

<p>
Their next step was to partition the building
among the various sections of the company.  Royce
and Challis took up their quarters in the room in
which the former had slept on the occasion of his
first visit.  The Hausas were given a larger chamber
near the south wall, and the rest of the party a
half-roofed enclosure at the other end.  The rainy
season not having commenced, the natives would
not be likely to suffer from their partial exposure.
</p>

<p>
The fort, small as it was, was too large to be
defended by forty men against serious attack.  To
make the most of his garrison, Royce arranged that
each man should have about three yards of wall to
defend.  If the enemy should pluck up resolution
to make a simultaneous assault on all sides, they
were numerous enough to throw eight or ten men
against every one of the garrison, and the odds were
more than sufficient for success.
</p>

<p>
The only weapons available for B Company,
as Challis called the released prisoners, were the
tools included in their camp equipment&mdash;mallets,
hatchets, hammers, a saw, and a few tent pegs.
</p>

<p>
Though so ill provided, Royce thought that in
day time the defence would have a sporting chance.
The rifles could take toll of the enemy while they
were advancing over the three or four hundred
yards of fairly open ground beneath the fort; and
even if the attack were pushed home to the walls,
it would be possible to reinforce the men in the
quarter where the assault was hottest.
</p>

<p>
A night attack would be much more difficult to
meet.  Covered by the darkness, the enemy might
approach to within a few yards of the walls without
being detected, if they moved quietly; without
suffering much loss, if they were heard.  At the
walls their numbers would tell far more effectually
than in daylight.  With such odds in their favour,
it would seem impossible to keep them out.  And
if once they got in, the garrison must inevitably
be overwhelmed.
</p>

<p>
But the Englishmen had little fear of a night
attack.  It was more likely that the Tubus would
move in the twilight of early morning.  This
would be little less formidable.  They might creep
a long way up the hill before they were seen, and
the chance of checking their rush would be small.
</p>

<p>
From the defensive point of view the weakest
spot in the surroundings of the fort was a patch
of rocky scrub-covered ground about a hundred
and fifty yards away on the north-east side.  It
provided good cover for an advance up the hill, and
left only a short distance for the final charge.
From the attackers' point of view the disadvantage
of this spot was that it was small in extent, and
would give cover to only a limited number of men.
</p>

<p>
The day having passed undisturbed, Royce could
not help feeling a little anxious about the night.
What if the Tubus should attack, after all?  He
decided to keep half the garrison on guard while
the rest slept, and to send three or four of the most
trustworthy Hausas some way down the hill to
act as scouts and give warning of any movement
of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Both he and Challis, during their spells of
watching, went round and round the walls with the
regularity of soldiers doing sentry-go.  Eyes and
ears were tensely on the alert; not a sound escaped
them.  The little various noises made by birds,
insects, and small animals darting through the scrub
were sometimes smothered by sounds from the
distant camp.  At one time the din was so loud
that Challis, who was on duty at the moment, was
almost on the point of awakening Royce.  But
he reflected that warriors intending a night attack,
even though savages, would have the common-sense
to move quietly, and he took himself to task
for what he considered a tendency to panic.
</p>

<p>
"I mustn't get jumpy," he said to himself;
"but this is a great change from camping on
Salisbury Plain."
</p>

<p>
In the morning, as soon as the sky began to
lighten, Royce set the men to work again on repairing
the walls.  Presently he caught sight of some
of the enemy in the distance.  They were evidently
watching the fort.  A little later one of them fired,
and at odd times during the morning there was
fitful sniping whenever the workers allowed
themselves to be seen above the walls.  But no one was
hit, and the Hausas' contempt for the Tubus'
marksmanship was voiced by John.
</p>

<p>
"Dey good for nuffin, sah," he said.  "You hold
a bottle, me hit him; dem fellas no can hit a house."
</p>

<p>
Working in squads, the men had by midday
completely blocked up the gateway, and repaired
all the breaches that were dangerous.
</p>

<p>
"I feel better now," said Royce, as he sat with
Challis, eating the scanty meal which had to serve
them for dinner.  "Of course, they could still
take the place by a determined rush; but, if they
attempt it, they'll suffer more heavily than if they
had had the sense or the pluck to come on before
we had finished."
</p>

<p>
"They'll play a waiting game," said Challis.
"How long will the grub last, do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"We can eke it out for ten days or so, by going
short.  I wonder if one of us could run the gauntlet
and make for the nearest British post?"
</p>

<p>
"It would take more than ten days to get there.
Everybody would starve before help came.  Besides,
there are only about a dozen men in charge, and
they wouldn't be strong enough to undertake an
expedition such a long distance, and fight their
way through some hundreds of horsemen."
</p>

<p>
"How many do you think they really muster?"
</p>

<p>
"I've never had a good enough view of them in
mass; but, at a guess, I should say six hundred
or so."
</p>

<p>
"They'll take some feeding."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but they have the whole country to forage
in, and I daresay there are foraging parties out in
all directions.  They may bring their total number
up to a thousand."
</p>

<p>
"Well, old sport, if we can manage to stick it
with our forty, we shall deserve at least a line or
two in history."
</p>

<p>
"Skittles!  I'd give a good deal not to be
mentioned in your history!"
</p>

<p>
"'One crowded hour of glorious life is worth an
age without a name.'"
</p>

<p>
"D'you call this glorious?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you?  I don't mean that it's glorious
to lick a crowd of heathens, but I do think it's a
fine thing to have been able to win the confidence
of our forty men."
</p>

<p>
"So it is, and it will be a finer thing to show that
we deserve it."
</p>

<p>
The day passed; dusk fell.  The arrangements
for the night were as before.  Royce took the first
watch, with half the garrison.
</p>

<p>
Challis, leaving him at his post on the north-east
bastion, made his way along the passages that
separated the several chambers of the building,
towards his quarters, picking his way carefully in
order not to trip over the fallen brick and other
debris that strewed the floor.
</p>

<p>
Turning a corner, he saw in the half-light, a
little way ahead, the figure of a negro cross his
path from left to right.  At first he thought it was
John or Kulana, the only men who might have any
reason to be in the neighbourhood of the white
men's quarters.  John looked after the food, which
had been placed in an adjacent chamber for
security; Kulana acted as body servant.
</p>

<p>
But it immediately occurred to Challis that
neither of the men had any business there at this
hour.  Then he remembered that John was actually
on duty with Royce.  Was it possible that some
other member of the party was making a private
raid on the stores?
</p>

<p>
He hurried on after the man, who had passed the
room in which the stores were kept and was going
in the direction of the well-yard.  His back was
towards Challis&mdash;a broad back, belonging to a man
of huge stature.
</p>

<p>
"Great snakes!" Challis inwardly ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
He quickened his pace.  The man heard his
steps, and glanced round; then dashed through a
ruined doorway leading to the well-yard.
</p>

<p>
Challis gave a shout and rushed after him.  It
was now dark inside the building, and he groped
about without finding the negro.  His shout had
brought Royce up at a run.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" he cried anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"A strange nigger&mdash;a big fellow&mdash;Goruba?"
said Challis.
</p>

<p>
"Surely not!" said Royce, flashing his electric
torch.  "There's no one here.'"
</p>

<p>
"He's got away.  We must search the place."
</p>

<p>
Together they scoured the whole building; no
trace of the man could be found.  None of the
garrison had left his post; every man declared
solemnly that no one had entered from outside,
nor gone out from within.
</p>

<p>
"If I didn't know you, old man," said Royce,
"I should say you had a fit of the jumps.  You
think it was Goruba?"
</p>

<p>
"It looked very much like that big fellow who
collared me.  But how could he have got in or
out?"
</p>

<p>
"It's decidedly rummy.  You remember Goruba
came on me suddenly, and John hadn't seen him.
Strange that you should have had almost the same
experience!"
</p>

<p>
"What did he come for, if it was Goruba?  To
spy out the position?"
</p>

<p>
"Not easy in the dark.  I confess it beats me.
How did the fellow get in?  It was hardly dark
outside, and our men must have seen him, one would
think.  Yet I believe them."
</p>

<p>
"We had better search for a secret passage
to-morrow, though I can't think we should have missed
it if there is one.  One thing is certain&mdash;Goruba
has some interest in this fort which we don't know.
That explains the persistence of the Tubus."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder!  Well, we can't do anything to-night.
I only hope it hasn't made our men jumpy.
It's an uncanny thing to find an enemy in your
midst unawares."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
A NIGHT ADVENTURE
</h3>

<p>
"I am a silly ass," said Challis, as the two
returned to the bastion.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what's the matter?" asked Royce,
smiling at his companion's disgusted tone.
</p>

<p>
"Why did I shout?  If I had held my tongue,
we might have kept this matter from the men.  As
it is, they are sure to have an attack of
nerves."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well! don't worry about it.  We can't
always do absolutely the best thing.  It's a mystery
how the fellow got in, and what he was up to.  We
must watch him if he tries it again."
</p>

<p>
As Challis feared, the men were restless.  Nobody
had much sleep that night, and the Englishmen
were unfeignedly glad when day dawned.
</p>

<p>
The day passed wearisomely.  The enemy were
seen moving about among the trees, but there
was no attack.
</p>

<p>
"You see that spur of forest yonder?" said
Royce in the afternoon, pointing to a clump on
the north-east side of the fort.  "It's only about
two hundred yards away, and would be a capital
vantage point for an attack.  Yet it's the only bit
of woodland which the enemy don't appear to
occupy.  I wonder why?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they think it's a little too near us,"
suggested Challis.  "It's within practically
point-blank range of our rifles."
</p>

<p>
"But there are so many of them that they could
afford to try a rush from that point.  It's very
strange.  Barring an occasional sniping shot towards
evening, nothing has happened from that quarter,
and the sniper has never done any damage."
</p>

<p>
"The Tubus' main camp is only a little to the
north of it.  They may not think it worth while to
occupy the second and smaller clump....  Tom,
I've been thinking."
</p>

<p>
"The same old problem?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the part we are no nearer to solving&mdash;the
food supply.  It is clear we are in for a siege.  The
men will soon get weary, as our stores diminish.
We shall be starved out inside a fortnight, even if
the men don't lose heart and begin to clamour."
</p>

<p>
"You are thinking of making a sally?"
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly.  Look at the position.  If we
stay, we starve; if we break out in a body, we shall
be pursued and surrounded.  But why shouldn't
some of us slip out and try to get help?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought we had settled that.  The nearest
British station is too far away; to get to the nearest
French one we should have to cross the Tubus'
country."
</p>

<p>
"But what about the natives of the neighbourhood?"
</p>

<p>
"All who are not massacred are in a stew of
fright, I expect.  They wouldn't lift a hand against
the Tubus."
</p>

<p>
"Not if one of us, either you or I, applied to
them?  The white man has a certain prestige, you
know.  Anyhow, I think it ought to be tried; in
fact, it must be.  I might revisit that old chap who
sold us provisions."
</p>

<p>
"Or I might.  It's my turn."
</p>

<p>
"Hang turns! I know the old chap."
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't I have the pleasure of his
acquaintance?  But, to avoid the eternal dispute,
let's toss again."
</p>

<p>
"Right-o!  I always win the toss.  Heads!"
</p>

<p>
"Tails it is!  Your luck is out.  Fate has more
respect for turns than you.  I'll go this very
night."
</p>

<p>
"You will want John as interpreter."
</p>

<p>
"It's a pity to reduce the garrison by two rifles,
but I'm afraid it can't be helped."
</p>

<p>
"And you had better take one of B Company
as guide.  They are no good with the rifle.  I'll
get John to choose a man."
</p>

<p>
"There's one advantage to you&mdash;you'll have
three fewer mouths to feed.  We'll only take a little
with us, and trust to chance to pick up more on the
way, if we need it."
</p>

<p>
"You must wait till the moon sets.  That will
be rather late to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  You'll let us down over the wall on the
north-east, towards that clump of trees you
mentioned.  There's apparently no danger there, and
we'll soon be under cover."
</p>

<p>
"The idea is to bring back reinforcements, of
course.  They must carry their own supplies.  I
don't think much of your chances, but I'm sure it's
worth trying."
</p>

<p>
"Whether we succeed or fail, we'll come back
by night.  We must arrange a signal, so that you
don't pot us by mistake."
</p>

<p>
"John imitates the jackal's cry to the life.  If
I hear three barks in quick succession, I shall
know it's you."
</p>

<p>
John was quite ready to accompany "Massa
Chally."  Without imputing cowardice to the
head-man, it is certain that he thought the plight of
the garrison desperate, and was not sorry to take
his chance outside rather than within the works.
He selected as guide a strapping young Kanura
named Mogra, who was well acquainted with the
country.
</p>

<p>
They had to wait until long past midnight for
the setting of the moon.  Challis did not regret the
delay.  By the time they could start the Tubus
would probably be well asleep.  Every night the
glow of their camp-fires could be seen at different
spots round the fort, and sounds were heard far
into the night from each of the camps.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion it seemed that the enemy turned
in even later than usual.  It was at least an hour
after the moon's disappearance that silence fell
upon the country.  Then the little band were let
down by a rope gently over the wall, on the side
farthest from the gateway.
</p>

<p>
Dark though it was, Challis thought it well to
crawl down the hillock until level ground was
reached.  Then the three stole along under cover
of the bushes towards the patch of woodland.
</p>

<p>
Half-way across, Challis inadvertently kicked a
loose stone, and paused, listening anxiously.  There
was no sound of alarm.  They reached the clump,
and crept through it, leaving the enemy's camp
on the left, and meeting no obstacle except the
undergrowth, in which they were all experienced
travellers.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why we shouldn't all have got out,"
said Challis to himself, feeling half-inclined to run
back and persuade Royce to join him.
</p>

<p>
But the hopelessness of such an attempt was
borne in upon him at once by a sound on his left.
The enemy's horses were snuffling and pawing the
ground, apparently between him and the campfire.
Even if the garrison could leave the fort
quietly enough to escape instant detection, they
must move slowly, burdened with packs as they
would be.  Their tracks would be discovered in the
morning, and the mounted Tubus could overtake
them in a few hours.
</p>

<p>
Challis had just dismissed the idea of a general
exodus as impracticable, when the slight sounds
made by the horses swelled to a considerable noise.
The snuffling became snorting and whinnying, and
there mingled with it one or two human calls.  Could
the flight have been discovered?
</p>

<p>
Mogra was leading, with John close behind,
Challis third of the line.  At the commotion the
guide was seized with panic, and was bolting blindly
forward, when John dashed up behind him, caught
him by the neck, and bade him, in language which
he understood, not to be a fool.
</p>

<p>
They went on, carefully picking their way through
the scrub.  The noise on their left rear increased.
They heard numbers of horses galloping away to
the north and north-east, and many men shouting.
Challis wondered whether the Tubus had been
drawn away by sudden news from their own
country, or by some false alarm.  Then a gust of
wind striking him from the right suggested a more
likely explanation.  The wind was carrying his
scent to the camp.  Unused to the scent of a white
man, the horses had taken fright and stampeded,
followed hot-foot by their owners.
</p>

<p>
In order to get well out of the current of possible
pursuit, Challis ordered Mogra to bear more to the
east.  They pushed on steadily for two hours.  By
this time dawn was approaching.
</p>

<p>
In the half-light they suddenly caught sight of
four or five big shapes moving slowly through the
morning mist across their path some little distance
ahead.  At the spot where they had arrived there
were no bushes to give cover, and Challis ordered
the men in a whisper to fling themselves flat on the
ground.
</p>

<p>
There was no cause for alarm, but rather for
self-congratulation.  In less than a minute they
recognised the misty shapes as riderless horses.
</p>

<p>
"What luck!" thought Challis.  "Provided
their riders are not anywhere near, John," he said,
"you and Mogra must catch three of those horses.
If I try, they will scent me and bolt.  I'll keep
guard."
</p>

<p>
The two negroes set off.  Challis watched their
tactics admiringly.  They crept on all fours round to
leeward of the horses, which were grazing on
low-growing plants, and drew near to them by almost
imperceptible degrees.  Suddenly they sprang up,
dashed forward, and had two halters in their
hands.
</p>

<p>
Mogra led the two captured horses to Challis,
while John went ahead after the others, which had
galloped away.  In ten minutes he returned, all
smiles and triumph.
</p>

<p>
"Berry fine horse for massa," he cried.  "Me
tink dis one no good, dat one no good; massa
must have bestest; here him are, sah, sure and
sartin."
</p>

<p>
It was a fine grey mare, thin fetlocked, slender
in the flanks, with a noble head.  Challis tried
to mount, but the mare bucked and curvetted,
with evident dislike of handling by a white man.
Challis's difficulties with it amused John, whose
horse was perfectly docile.  A little patient coaxing
and the gift, happily inspired, of a roasted nut from
Challis's wallet, reconciled the animal to her new
master; and Challis found himself mounted on the
best bit of horseflesh he had ever had the luck to
bestride.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, Mogra!" he called.
</p>

<p>
Mogra was bashful.  The third horse stood quite
still, as if inviting the man to mount; but he had
never been on horseback, and stood holding the
halter with an air of weighing the chances of getting
safely into the saddle.
</p>

<p>
John rocked with laughter, when Mogra, at last
plucking up courage, fumbled for the stirrup and
almost fell under the horse's belly, still clinging to
the halter.
</p>

<p>
"Get down and help him," said Challis, anxious
to be off.
</p>

<p>
John dismounted and hoisted Mogra into the
saddle by main force.
</p>

<p>
"Him silly chap, sah," he said grinning.
"Tumble off, sure 'nuff."
</p>

<p>
But Mogra did not tumble off.  Now that he
was on, he determined to stick fast.  Gripping the
animal with his bare knees, wearing an expression
compounded of grim determination and the fear
of sudden death, he no doubt owed his stability
to the placid temperament of his steed.  Challis
set a slow pace, so that the man might grow
accustomed to his unfamiliar position, and the three
rode on together.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
ATTACKED BY LIONS
</h3>

<p>
Challis had already decided not to make for
the village at which Royce had obtained supplies.
It lay far on the other side of the fort, and Mogra
did not know it.  Mogra had suggested that they
should go to his own village, which was only a day's
march eastward of the fort, and to this Challis had
agreed.
</p>

<p>
On horseback they made better progress than
on foot, and soon after midday came in sight of
the village.  At the first glimpse of it Mogra uttered
a wail&mdash;there were signs that here, too, the Tubus
had been at their desolating work.  And in truth,
when the horsemen rode into the wide street, their
passage was through ruins.  Not a house was
standing; neither human being nor brute beast
was to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"What has become of all the people?" said
Challis.  "Surely they can't all have been carried
away as slaves?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sah&mdash;old men no good, old women no
good," said John.  "All gone dead."
</p>

<p>
"But there are no dead bodies&mdash;no remains of
any kind," said Challis with a shudder.
</p>

<p>
John confessed that he, too, was puzzled at this
remarkable fact.  Turning to Mogra, he demanded,
with a sort of remonstrant anger, where all the
young man's people were.  And then Mogra told
a little story.
</p>

<p>
"In the days of our fathers," he said, "long,
long ago, the bad men came to this village even
as they have done these few days past, and it is
told that my people learnt beforehand of their
coming, and went a day's journey to the east, and
there took refuge in a cave.  I have never been
there, nor my father, nor any of the people of his
age; but the cave is known to certain of the old
men of the village, and it may be that they have
led our people there."
</p>

<p>
John translated this in his own queer way.
</p>

<p>
"It sounds very romantic," remarked Challis
musingly.
</p>

<p>
"Berry big lie, sah!" said John decisively.
</p>

<p>
"Come, now, you mustn't call Mogra a liar!
Ask him if he can lead us there."
</p>

<p>
"Him say savvy way little bit, den him go lost,"
said John, after questioning the man.
</p>

<p>
"Well, let him try the little bit; there's no harm
in that.  If he comes to a check, we must trust to
luck."
</p>

<p>
Mogra showed no hesitation at the start; but,
after riding for a couple of hours, he declared that
he could guide them no farther.
</p>

<p>
"Does he know what sort of country is round
about the cave?" asked Challis.
</p>

<p>
It was bare and rocky, said Mogra, with hardly
any vegetation; but he remembered having heard
that one particularly large tree stood in front of
the cave.
</p>

<p>
"We will cast about for that, then," said Challis.
"Let us take different directions."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no!" said John energetically.  "Go
all same one way."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, if you are afraid of our losing one
another, we will all go together."
</p>

<p>
They rode on, searching the country over a
wide area; but the afternoon was wearing to evening,
and they had still lighted on no trace of the
cave.  Challis began to think they had better give
it up and make for another village before night
enveloped them.
</p>

<p>
The horses were growing tired, and showed signs
of uneasiness which Challis was puzzled to account
for.  The explanation came with startling
suddenness.  On rounding a rocky eminence they saw,
only a hundred yards away, two lions lying side
by side.
</p>

<p>
The trembling horses reared, backed, then turned
tail and fled in terror.  Mogra was thrown almost
at once, and neither Challis nor John could check
their horses for a considerable distance.  When at
last they regained control over them, they returned,
afraid that Mogra might have been pursued by
the beasts and by this time be torn in pieces.
</p>

<p>
They were relieved in a few minutes to see him
running towards them at the speed of a hunted
deer.  There was no sign of the lions; Challis
conjectured that they were digesting a heavy meal.
Mogra was shaking with fright, but unhurt
except for a bruise or two.  His horse had
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
As they stood discussing what to do next, John
caught sight of a number of men in the distance.
Two or three at the head of the party appeared
to be carrying something among them.
</p>

<p>
"Him say belong him," said John, after a word
from Mogra.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him to call them," Challis commanded.
The men turned at Mogra's shout; but they
evidently did not recognise him in the distance,
and no doubt supposed the horsemen to be Tubus,
for they hurried on with every sign of distress.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Yoi-aloo!  Yoi-aloo!</i>" bawled John.  "White
man!  White man! ... Berry silly chaps, sah!"
</p>

<p>
"Let us ride towards them," said Challis.
"Stay!  Let Mogra run ahead."
</p>

<p>
They remained stationary, while Mogra hastened
to his friends, who soon came to a halt.  Mogra
ran back.  He explained that they were carrying
to the cave the son of their chief, who had been
mauled by one of the lions.  One of their fellows
had already been eaten.  They were willing that
the white man should accompany them to the cave.
</p>

<p>
The party reached it just before dark.  Challis
was surprised to find that its entrance was fully
exposed&mdash;a large hole in the side of a rocky hill.
He concluded that its security lay in its being
situated in a desolate region that was unlikely to
tempt any raiding party.
</p>

<p>
An attempt had been made to render it more
defensible by blocking up the entrance with trees
felled on the hillside.  The large tree of which
Mogra had spoken, the configuration of the ground,
and a few scattered cactus plants screened it from
view from a distance.
</p>

<p>
The entrance was dark, but the interior of the
cave was faintly illuminated by torches.  When
the party entered, the horses being tethered to
the tree, the strangers were at first ignored in the
general excitement and lamentation over the
injuries of the chief's son.
</p>

<p>
His was the third case in two days.  Examining
his wounds, the chief, a bearded man of about
sixty years, wrung his hands with grief, and the
women howled in concert.
</p>

<p>
It was some time before Challis got an opportunity
of explaining through John the object of
his visit, of which Mogra had already given his
version.  On hearing his story, the chief refused
to assist him.
</p>

<p>
"What the white man asks is too hard a thing,"
he said.  "How can I, with only eighty men of
fighting age, expect to accomplish anything against
a multitude of Tubus?  They have guns, we have
none; they have horses, we have none.  It is
too hard a thing."
</p>

<p>
John expostulated, pleaded, at last threatened;
and Challis, perceiving that his well-meant efforts
only annoyed the old man and made him more
obdurate, decided not to press the matter for the
moment.  It was something gained that the chief
consented to shelter the strangers for the night.
For safety's sake they brought the horses in.
</p>

<p>
During the hours of darkness the lions could
be heard roaring in the neighbourhood of the cave.
At moments they seemed to be almost at the
entrance, and the negroes shivered with terror
lest the beasts should break in.  They could not
light a fire&mdash;usually, though not always, effectual
in scaring away lions&mdash;for fear the glare should
betray the position of the cave to the Tubus.  It
seemed that they had escaped human foes only to
fall a prey to foes still more formidable.
</p>

<p>
Challis passed a very uncomfortable night.
The atmosphere of the cave was nauseating.  The
villagers, more than two hundred in number, had
brought many of their cattle with them, and the
place, large as it was, was overcrowded.
</p>

<p>
The foul air, the roaring of the lions outside,
the lowing of the cattle within, and his own worried
thoughts, combined to banish sleep; and at the
first sign of dawn Challis was glad to escape into
the fresh air.  He took his rifle, and left the cave,
to think matters over in the cool freshness of the
morning.
</p>

<p>
It was a pity that, having found Mogra's tribe,
he could not avail himself of the eighty fighting
men of whom the chief had spoken.  Yet he could
not think of any argument, any inducement, that
was likely to prevail over the old man's reluctance.
Apparently, he must travel further in search of
help.
</p>

<p>
Walking along, lost in thought, he came upon
a watercourse worn by a small stream in the rocky
surface of the hillside.  He was on the point of
turning back, for walking was aimless except as
an aid to thought.  But suddenly his eye was
caught by a slight movement behind a rock on the
far side of the nullah, at this point about eight
yards broad and six feet deep.
</p>

<p>
The object which had attracted his notice was
a moving patch of dusky brown.  It had disappeared,
but a moment later again rose into view.
And then Challis was galvanised from meditation
into a state of mind keenly practical, for the
brownish patch resolved itself into the shaggy head
of a lion.
</p>

<p>
In another moment he perceived a lioness,
standing behind and slightly lower than her mate.
Both were watching him.
</p>

<p>
For perhaps five seconds surprise held him
spellbound.  He stood with fascinated eyes fixed on
the lions; they, at first somewhat sleepy looking,
were becoming more and more alert, growling with
a deep rumble.  Then, following the instinct of a
sportsman, he raised his rifle, and, aiming at the
forehead of the animal he had seen first, he fired.
</p>

<p>
There was an angry roar; the lion sprang over
the low rock, and dashed straight at Challis across
the nullah.
</p>

<p>
Tingling with high-strung excitement, Challis
fired again, apparently without effect, and felt that
his last moment was come.
</p>

<p>
But the lion's spring was a few inches short.
Just as Challis was nervously fitting a new cartridge,
the beast struck the bank of the nullah within two
feet of where he was standing, and fell back into
the stream.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
A FATAL LEAP
</p>

<p>
Challis seized the opportunity which he could
hardly have hoped for.  Aiming behind the lion's
shoulder, he fired again, and the beast rolled over,
clawing the air.
</p>

<p>
The lioness, meanwhile, sullenly growling, had
risen from behind the boulder and was slowly
retreating.  Challis was almost too flurried to
take good aim; but he chanced a shot, again
directing it behind the shoulder.  He could hardly
believe his eyes when the animal dropped without
a sound.
</p>

<p>
"That's something in return for a poor night's
lodging," he said to himself as he walked back to
the cave.
</p>

<p>
The first shot had drawn his own men and a
number of the villagers to the entrance, and they
had witnessed the fall of the dread beasts.  Loud
shouts acclaimed the white man's prowess.  It
seemed that the people could not do enough to show
their gratitude.
</p>

<p>
And the chief had now completely changed his
mind.  Impressed by the slaying of the lions, he
was willing to give the help he had formerly refused.
</p>

<p>
"It is wonderful," he said, spreading his hands.
"The white man has slain with his marvellous gun
the beasts that slew my people and wounded my
son.  Shall I not do something in return?  Never
have I seen such a marvellous deed!"
</p>

<p>
Challis thanked him.  Later on, when he went
back and examined the dead lions, he did not think
it necessary to inform the chief that the lioness
had been killed by what was really a miss.  He had
aimed behind the shoulder, but he found that the
shot had entered at the ear and pierced the brain.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
TRAINING AN ARMY
</h3>

<p>
After Challis's adventure with the lions, the
villagers, as the way of negroes is, were just as
eager to help the white man as they had formerly
been reluctant.
</p>

<p>
A man who, unaided, could kill two lions was
surely a very wonderful person.  Not even the
dreaded Tubus could stand against him.  It would
be a blessing to the whole countryside if the power
of the Tubus were broken.  The white man asked
their help&mdash;he should have it.
</p>

<p>
The chief ordered all the males of the
community to assemble in front of the cave.  His
eighty fighting-men, splendid specimens of
muscular humanity, gathered in a disorderly crowd on
one side.  Some were almost naked, others wore a
sort of shawl folded about them as a Scots shepherd
folds his plaid; it left one shoulder bare, and
descended to the knee.  All carried spears about
four feet long.
</p>

<p>
The other group comprised the boys, the elderly
men, and the few weaklings of the tribe.
</p>

<p>
"I will make Boy Scouts of some of them,"
said Challis to himself as he viewed them.
</p>

<p>
The chief led him in and out among the crowd
of warriors, pointing to one man as a famous
hunter, to another as a mighty thrower of the
spear, to a third whose body was scarred with
wounds received in fight.  He was evidently proud
of his men.
</p>

<p>
"Let the white man take them at once," he
said, John interpreting.  "They are well fed;
they have eaten the flesh of oxen; they are ready
even now to follow the killer of lions."
</p>

<p>
He was as much astonished as disappointed when
Challis explained, as tactfully as he could, that he
did not yet consider them ready to accompany
him back to the fort.
</p>

<p>
"What more does the white man need?" he
asked, somewhat huffily.
</p>

<p>
Challis reflected for a few moments before
replying.  He did not quite know how to deal
with these ignorant natives, so prompt to take
offence and sulk like children.  But he was clear
in his own mind.
</p>

<p>
To render effective service against experienced
warriors like the Tubus, dashing horsemen armed
with guns, accustomed to carry all before them in
a wild charge, something more than muscle and
goodwill was required.
</p>

<p>
It was plain that these natives were wholly
undisciplined.  Challis felt sure that in battle
every man acted for himself, without any relation
to his comrades, and he had already resolved that
they must undergo some sort of elementary training
before they could be of any real use.
</p>

<p>
The matter that worried him was the shortness
of time.  Royce's provisions might be eked out
over a fortnight&mdash;what could be done in a fortnight
towards training these wild, untutored children of
nature?
</p>

<p>
"You know the Tubus, chief," he said, making
up his mind to be frank.  "Your people have
suffered at their hands&mdash;even now you have fled
from them.  They have horses and guns&mdash;you
know how helpless your best warriors have been
before them.  We must change all that.  Your
men must learn how to fight in such a way that
the Tubus' advantages over them are lessened."
</p>

<p>
This was the gist of his speech, which was very
much longer, and expressed in simple words that
John could translate.  The chief, in spite of the
fact that his men had recently run away from the
Tubus, seemed annoyed that any doubt was cast
on their capacity.  But, after a while, he asked
sullenly what the white man wished to do.
</p>

<p>
"First of all, I want you to send messengers to
all the friendly villages round about, asking the
chiefs to send their best fighting men to join us.
Tell them that we are going to fight the Tubus,
and put a stop to their evil deeds."
</p>

<p>
"That shall be done, O white man!"
</p>

<p>
"Then I want to see what your own men can
do with the spear, how they march, and how they
attack."
</p>

<p>
"That shall be done, O white man!"
</p>

<p>
He gave an order.  The warriors formed up,
as Challis expected, in single file, and marched
thus, lithely as wild animals, before him.  At
another order they started to run, uttering fierce
yells, crowding into an unwieldy mob, and flinging
their spears high into the air.  The chief watched
them proudly, and glanced at Challis as if to say:
"Can you wish for anything better than that?"
</p>

<p>
"It is very good," said Challis, to the chief's
great contentment.  "Now bring them back; I
want to find out which are the best spearmen."
</p>

<p>
The men, gathering their spears, came running
back in a scattered crowd, and collected again in
their former shapeless array.
</p>

<p>
Asking permission from the chief, Challis ordered
John to form the men up in line.  It was a long
and difficult business.  No sooner were a few of
the negroes placed shoulder to shoulder than one
man would step out to see what a particular friend
of his was doing some distance away, and showed
a good deal of resentment when John hauled him
back and explained vigorously that he must not
move without leave.
</p>

<p>
Then another man would find that he had
something urgent to say to his mother, among the
crowd of women watching the scene curiously,
and he would sprint across the ground, engage in
animated dialogue with the old woman, and return
at his leisure.
</p>

<p>
John was reduced to despair.
</p>

<p>
"Silly fellas, sure 'nuff, sah!" he said in
dudgeon.  "Dey no good&mdash;too much fools, all
same!"
</p>

<p>
An idea occurred to Challis.  Knowing from
his past experience with the Hausas how keenly
negroes enter into competition one with another,
he ordered John to explain that, if the men kept
the line, he would give prizes to the best spearmen
as soon as they reached the fort, and make them
his own bodyguard.
</p>

<p>
After the men had gathered into a crowd and
squabbled noisily for several minutes, this offer had
the desired effect.  They allowed themselves to
be formed into a line, which, however, all John's
efforts could not prevent from gradually assuming
a crescent shape.  Then, one by one, after several
failures to make them act in turn, they threw their
spears at the word of command.  In this way,
Challis selected the twenty men whose cast was the
longest and straightest, and they immediately
rushed across to the spectators to proclaim their
merits.
</p>

<p>
By this time Challis was very tired.
</p>

<p>
"Drilling my platoon in the O.T.C. was nothing
to this," he said to himself.  "How in the world
can I make anything of them in a fortnight?"
</p>

<p>
But after rest and food, he was ready to tackle
the work again, and he took heart when he found
that the negroes were much more amenable.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of emulation he had excited among
them lightened the task.  Every man seemed
anxious to win praise from the white man.  The
idea had got abroad among them that the exercises
to which he put them were so much "white man's
medicine," something that would have a mystic
efficacy when they came in contact with the enemy.
As this idea implied unquestioning faith, it was all
that Challis required.
</p>

<p>
He was careful not to keep them too long at
one thing.  When they had at last seized the idea
of a straight line, though still far from successful
in achieving it, he set the twenty selected spearmen
to compete among themselves, and devoted his
attention to the sixty less proficient.
</p>

<p>
These he determined to turn into pikemen.  He
got them to cut longer shafts for their spear heads
and to sharpen the lower end, so that by the close
of the day they were provided with serviceable
pikes eight feet long.
</p>

<p>
The end of the day brought its disappointment.
The messengers dispatched by the chief to neighbouring
villages returned and reported the complete
failure of their mission.  Such was the universal
dread of the Tubus that no chief was willing to
send his men to encounter them.  Not even the
messengers' report of the lion-killing sufficed to
overcome their fears.
</p>

<p>
"They will sit on the fence," thought Challis.
"If we have any success, they'll come tumbling
over each other to help.  Well, we haven't done
so badly for the first day.  I must make plans for
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
He spent that night, not in the fœtid cave, but
in the open, protected from wild beasts by a ring
of bonfires.  After all, he thought, they were too
far from the Tubus' camps to attract attention.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, after repeating the lessons of
the previous day, and finding that the men gave
much less trouble, he taught them how to extend,
moving them up and down with fair success.
With John's assistance, he got them to turn right
or left at the word of command.
</p>

<p>
At first they laughed so heartily at the sight of
one another moving like teetotums that discipline
was in danger of breaking down.  Challis himself
was amused, thinking how wrathful the loud-voiced
drill-instructor at his old school would have been
if the boys had taken their drill as lightheartedly
as these negroes.  But after a time they settled
down to learn their new prescription in "white
man's medicine," and made the proper movements
with creditable smartness.
</p>

<p>
The next operation was to form three sides of a
square&mdash;their numbers did not suffice for a full
square of any considerable size.  This was difficult.
</p>

<p>
"Do their minds work in curves?" thought
Challis despairingly, as the men tended persistently
to round the angles and join the ends of the lines.
</p>

<p>
But even this difficulty was surmounted with
patience, and the close of the second day saw him
one step nearer the accomplishment of his aim&mdash;to
train the negroes to sustain the assaults of a
mounted enemy.
</p>

<p>
It was the next stage that he found most difficult
of all.  A good shot himself, he sighed for rifles,
that he might teach the men to shoot.  With such
obsolete weapons as spears and pikes he felt
himself at a loss.
</p>

<p>
But common sense and recollections of what
he had read about Cromwell's army came to his
aid.  He taught the men forming the three-sided
square to stand fast with their pikes planted
obliquely in the ground, supported with the left
hand, while they held in the right their short
stabbing spears.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile he practised the twenty selected men
in pushing out in advance, casting their spears,
and then running back for refuge into the square.
The whole force learnt to lie down at the word of
command, to rise, to advance, to retire.
</p>

<p>
In order to accustom them as much as possible
to the conditions they would have to meet, he got
the chief to send into the neighbourhood to hunt
up or purchase horses.  Such of the men as could
ride he mounted, and he organised sham charges,
so that the men on foot grew used to the approach
of horses at the gallop.
</p>

<p>
By the end of the fifth day the negroes had
entered into all these exercises with spirit and
enjoyment.  Nothing pleased them better than
the charges of the few horsemen.  The spearmen
would advance some twenty paces in front of the
pikemen, pretend to discharge their spears when
the horsemen came within range, then turn and
run back between the open ranks of the pikemen,
whose weapons were planted at an angle calculated
to transfix the oncoming horses and men.
</p>

<p>
When the spearmen had run behind the pikemen,
they would wheel round and discharge another
flight of spears.  The horsemen carried their sham
charge to within a few yards of the spears before
they reined up.  In their ardour, indeed, they
sometimes failed to obey promptly the order to
halt, and one or two of them received ugly wounds.
But they took these in good part, and, when the
day's work was done, were to be seen proudly
displaying their injuries to their relatives.
</p>

<p>
"I only hope they will be as cheerful in the
real thing," thought Challis.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
THE MYSTERY DEEPENS
</h3>

<p>
When Challis and John crept down the hill
that dark night, Royce remained for some time
at the wall, listening anxiously for sounds which
would indicate whether the Tubus had discovered
them.
</p>

<p>
For a time all was silent; there was not even a
rustle; he hoped all was well.  But presently the
thud of galloping horses and the shouts of men
sent a shiver down his spine.  Was his friend being
pursued?
</p>

<p>
A moment's thought relieved his fears.  If
Challis had been caught, the negroes would not
have needed to ride after him.  If he had once got
past them, they would hardly be aware of it.  He
concluded that something had caused the animals
to stampede.  Challis might be trusted to avoid
being ridden down.
</p>

<p>
Reassured though he was, Royce spent an uneasy
night.  After setting a double watch at each corner
of the fort, he turned in, but set his alarm clock to
wake him in an hour.  He then made a round of
the fort, to assure himself that the sentries were not
asleep.
</p>

<p>
It was not easy, as he knew, to keep negroes
awake on guard.  The necessity of waking so
frequently, after short naps, was very wearing.
</p>

<p>
"By the time Tom gets back," he thought, "I
shall be half dead with fatigue."
</p>

<p>
About dawn he had reason to be glad that he
had not spared himself.  He found the men on
duty at the south-west corner fast asleep.  Rousing
them, not too gently, he looked out over the wall
to see for himself whether there was any sign of
the enemy.
</p>

<p>
His first impression was one of relief.  There was
no indication of anything unusual, so far as he
could see in the grey dawn.
</p>

<p>
A second glance, however, raised a doubt.
There seemed to be more bushes on the slope than
he remembered on this side of the fort.  Here and
there, projecting slightly above the general
contour, there were dark, shapeless masses.
</p>

<p>
He called up Kulana, who acted as interpreter
in John's absence.
</p>

<p>
"You see those?" he said quietly.  "What
are they?"
</p>

<p>
The objects were very dim and indistinct.  The
man peered at them, and in a moment said, in the
same hushed tone as Royce had used:
</p>

<p>
"Dem bushes, sah."
</p>

<p>
Kulana, however, was hardly awake yet.  One
of the negro guards, who had had time to collect
himself, noticed Kulana and his master staring at
something on the hillside.  He, too, peered into
the semi-darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Men!" he exclaimed excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"No, bushes!" rejoined Kulana.
</p>

<p>
They were raising their voices in dispute, each
sticking to his opinion, and Royce bade them be
silent.  Unable to decide the matter himself, he
felt that he dared take no risks.  Quietly
summoning the garrison, he sent them to their allotted
posts behind the wall, ordering them to be careful
not to show their heads above it.
</p>

<p>
Then he resolved to put the matter to the test.
Taking his rifle, he fired just above the nearest of
the suspicious objects, not directly aiming at it,
hoping that fright would effect his purpose.
</p>

<p>
The result was immediate, and though not
wholly unexpected, was none the less surprising.
The harmless discharge of his rifle was followed
by a movement recalling the effect of a gunshot
on a covey of hidden birds.  The hillside seemed
to start into life and motion.  A number of low,
dark forms sprang up in the half-light, swiftly
descended the hill, and disappeared in the mist on
the level ground beyond.
</p>

<p>
"A surprise for them instead of the one they
intended for me," thought Royce.  "I hope they
won't try it again; it is hateful to shoot the poor
wretches, but there's nothing else for it if they
attack."
</p>

<p>
Only the knowledge of the miseries these pests
of the country had inflicted on scores of peaceable
villages reconciled Royce to the part he felt himself
called upon to play.
</p>

<p>
He seized the occasion to impress upon his men
the necessity for watchfulness while on duty.
</p>

<p>
"Your falling asleep," he said to the two
repentant sentries, "might have led to the capture
of the fort, and the death or enslavement of all
of us.  Take care in future."
</p>

<p>
During the day it occurred to him that the men
would be all the better for active employment.
At the same time, in view of the attempted surprise,
it was advisable still further to strengthen
their defences.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, he set them to dig a ditch a few
feet inside the wall.  The proper place for it was
outside, of course; but to dig it there would expose
them to danger.  Moreover, the Tubus might fill
it up or bridge it.  If it were inside, on the other
hand, it would form an unexpected obstacle should
they scale the wall.
</p>

<p>
There was not enough water to make a moat of
it; but, dug to a depth of several feet, it would
seriously embarrass the attackers, even though
dry.
</p>

<p>
The men at the north-east corner, when they
had dug about six feet below the surface, came
suddenly upon something hard, upon which the
sharpened stones they used as spades made no
impression.  They reported the discovery to Royce,
who went to the spot and jumped down so that he
might examine the obstruction.
</p>

<p>
It proved to be a course of brickwork.  Taking
the spade, Royce dug the earth away from its edge
for several feet, wondering what purpose the bricks
served.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-167.jpg" alt="THE DISCOVERY IN THE DITCH" />
<br />
THE DISCOVERY IN THE DITCH
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, he thought, they were part of some
building still more ancient than the fort itself.
It would be interesting to excavate more thoroughly,
and find out whether anything of value,
in the shape of old weapons, coins, or pottery, lay
beneath the foundations.
</p>

<p>
But that must be a task for the future.  At
present the business in hand was the completion of
the ditch.  The bricks being almost level with the
bottom of the part which had already been dug
out, he decided that it was unnecessary to remove
them, and he ordered the men to go on with their
work in another direction.
</p>

<p>
By dusk that evening the ditch was half finished.
Royce, after eating his scanty supper, was sitting
alone, tired out, wondering what had happened to
Challis, whether he would succeed in getting help,
how long it would be before he came back.
</p>

<p>
All at once he heard a shout of alarm, followed
by a cry of pain.  Springing up, he rushed in the
direction of the sounds.  The whole garrison was
in a ferment, and two of the men had reached the
scene before him.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" he cried, thinking that perhaps
some of the men had been quarrelling.
</p>

<p>
But on his arrival he found one of the Hausas
groaning with pain, supported by his two comrades.
They pointed to a gash in the man's thigh.
</p>

<p>
"Bring him along," said Royce to Kulana,
deferring questions until he had rendered first-aid.
</p>

<p>
They carried the man to Royce's room.  Royce
took some lint from his medical stores, soaked
it in water, and tied it tightly over the wound.
He saw at once that the injury was not serious,
and the cut, being clean, would heal in a few
days.
</p>

<p>
"Now, how did it happen?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The negro told Kulana that he had suddenly
seen beside him a stranger, a man of immense size,
very fierce-looking, with two long scars on each
cheek.  He had given a shout of alarm and rushed
at the man, who was moving stealthily towards the
well-yard.  At the shout the stranger turned, dug
his knife savagely into the Hausa's side, and rushed
away.
</p>

<p>
Royce wished that he had questioned the man
before.  It would be hopeless to search for the
intruder now.  From the description, he had no
doubt that it was Goruba, who had entered the
fort for the second time in some mysterious way.
</p>

<p>
Royce was staggered.  How had the man contrived
again to get in unperceived?  What sentries
could cope with him?  What could be his object
in coming alone into the fort?  Why was he
running such risks in venturing unsupported among
a garrison whom he knew to be well-armed and
watchful?
</p>

<p>
"I must solve this mystery," Royce said to
himself.  "The men are scared out of their wits,
and if this sort of thing is to happen their courage
will melt away.  There must be a secret entrance
somewhere.  To-morrow I'll search the place
thoroughly again, though, upon my word, we have been
through it so often that I can't for the life of me
conceive where the rat's hole can be."
</p>

<p>
He gave the wounded man a sleeping-draught,
did his best to calm the fears of the rest, and
remained on guard all night, in case another alarm
should create a panic.

CHAPTER XXI
<br /><br />
A BLOW FOR LIBERTY
</h3>

<p>
Challis grudged every day spent in training,
lest the fort should be stormed by the Tubus before
he had come to the relief.  But he saw clearly
that only by training his little army would he
have the slightest chance of effecting a diversion
in favour of the beleaguered garrison.
</p>

<p>
The odds, in any case, were enormously against
him.  But at the end of the fifth day he had
unexpected encouragement.  About nightfall, just
as John was lighting the bonfires, he caught sight
of a crowd of armed negroes rounding a hillock
some distance away.
</p>

<p>
"Bad fellas coming, sah!" he shouted excitedly.
</p>

<p>
Challis blew a whistle he had shaped out of a
piece of wood, and his eighty men came pouring
out of the cave, and formed up in something
resembling the line which he had been at such
pains to teach.
</p>

<p>
They howled with disappointment at not receiving
the order to attack at once.  Challis got
the chief to send one of his men forward to hail the
strangers and ask the meaning of their coming.
</p>

<p>
It turned out that they were the fighting men
of a village about ten miles off, nearly a hundred
strong.  The story of the killing of the lions had
reached them, with the addition of all sorts of
wonderful details gathered in its course through the
countryside.  They had heard rumours also of
the marvellous medicine which the white man was
preparing for the Tubus, and they desired to see
these marvels for themselves.
</p>

<p>
Their chief and the elders of the village had
desired to take the cautious part and remain aloof;
but their counsels had been overborne by the
younger men, who had insisted on marching out
to see the white lion-killer and medicine man.
</p>

<p>
It was an opportunity too good to let slip.  In
the ruddy light of the bonfires, Challis put his men
through their evolutions.
</p>

<p>
Spurred by the desire to impress the strangers,
the men excelled themselves.  The result was
that the newcomers clamoured to be allowed to
join the forces of the great medicine man, and
Challis found himself stronger by nearly a hundred
vigorous, able-bodied young men.
</p>

<p>
The only drawback to this accession of strength
was the necessity of devoting more days to training.
Challis was so anxious about the welfare of Royce
and his little party that he sent a scout next day to
approach the neighbourhood of the fort and
discover whether the Tubus were still in position
there.
</p>

<p>
He set to work at once with the new men,
selecting forty to join his spearmen and making
pikemen of the rest.  These latter he posted as a
rear rank three feet behind the front rank, giving
them spears three feet longer.
</p>

<p>
The new men picked up the simple drill quickly,
having models in the original company.  But before
Challis had time to perfect them, his work was put
to a sudden test.
</p>

<p>
In the intervals of training his men, he had made
a point of studying the surrounding country with
an eye to its suitability for attacking or defensive
operations.
</p>

<p>
The cave was situated in a hilly, rocky district,
difficult for horsemen, but well adapted for defence
against a mounted force.  The side from which it
could be most easily rushed was from the direction
of the nullah which had been the scene of his
adventure with the lions.
</p>

<p>
A little below the spot at which this incident
had taken place the nullah disappeared.  The
stream which flowed through it in the rainy season
ran in a broad shallow channel, easily fordable, with
a rocky hill on one side and a practicable path
along the dry margin of the bed of the stream.
</p>

<p>
About two miles from the cave the rocky ground
on the right of the stream ended in a swamp,
formed by overflowings of a little river which Challis
had satisfied himself was identical with the stream
that flowed past the base of the hillock on which the
fort stood.  Into this river the shallow stream
emptied itself.
</p>

<p>
On the right, at the angle formed by the junction
of the two streams, there was a low-lying patch of
dry land, triangular in shape&mdash;an island inclosed
by streams and the swamp.  While this island
was at the present time dry, Challis had no doubt
that it was submerged when the streams were
flooded by the rains.
</p>

<p>
Challis had considered the possibility of being
attacked before he was ready to move out towards
the fort with his little army.  He decided that such
an attack, if it occurred, would most likely be made
from this direction, the ground being more level
and open than on any other side.  It was clear
that the best point at which to meet the attack
would be where the swamp approached most closely
to the steep hill on the left.
</p>

<p>
Including the shallow bed of the stream, about
fifty feet wide, there were altogether about a
hundred and fifty feet of firm dry land between
the swamp and the hillside, except for the stream,
now little more than a yard across.  Here his men
could best make their stand.
</p>

<p>
Since his arrival at the cave, Challis had insisted
on an elementary precaution which it is the habit
of negroes to neglect.  Every morning at dawn he
had sent out scouts in a southward direction, to
give notice if the enemy approached.  These men
took sufficient food for the day, and returned at
nightfall.
</p>

<p>
He arranged that the line of scouts should extend
for several miles towards the enemy's country,
each man posting himself within hailing distance
of the next.  By this means he ensured that he
should receive warning within a few seconds of the
sighting of the enemy by the remotest man.
</p>

<p>
On the sixth day after his arrival he had reason
to be glad of his forethought.  About noon the
nearest scout ran in with the news that a force of
Tubus was approaching from the direction of the
river.
</p>

<p>
A fact that somewhat surprised him was that
their line of march would bring them direct to the
cave, not to the village whence the people had
migrated.  It seemed as if they had information
of what was going on.  Was it possible that there
was a traitor in the camp?
</p>

<p>
With a little more experience of negro life he
would have divined the true explanation.  The
story of his doings had spread for many miles
around, gaining in magnitude with every repetition.
Certain of the neighbouring tribes purchased
immunity from attack by spying for the Tubus, and
there was no doubt that some of these people had
carried to Goruba the report that a white man was
making big medicine at the cave.
</p>

<p>
But it was not at all likely that Goruba had any
idea who the white man was, unless he had already
stormed the fort and discovered that it contained
one white man instead of two.  The probability was
that he was coming or had sent to test the truth
of the story he had heard.  The white man might
be a missionary, unlikely to trouble him.
</p>

<p>
Challis, it must be confessed, felt very nervous.
His men were as yet only partially trained; how
would they behave if it came to a fight?  Would
they forget all that he had tried to teach them,
and either run away from their dreaded enemy, or
rush forward in their old disorderly manner, and
fall an easy prey?  He looked forward to the test
with doubt and misgiving.
</p>

<p>
But he let no sign of his thoughts escape him.
Within three minutes of the scout's arrival he had
all his warriors ranged in double line.
</p>

<p>
"John," he said, "you will bring them along
and down the hill after me.  Be sure you do not
let them break the line."
</p>

<p>
Then, jumping on his horse, he cantered along the
bed of the nullah to the point where he had already
determined to make his stand.  One of the scouts
ran beside him.  On reaching the spot, he left his
horse with the scout and climbed the hill on the
left to get a view of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
It was some time before he was able to distinguish
them.  When he first caught sight of them they
were picking their way very slowly and cautiously
along the bank of the river.  They numbered, as
nearly as he could guess, about three hundred
men&mdash;a force which, mounted, armed with rifles,
and used to warfare, represented terrible odds
against fewer than two hundred raw levies, on foot,
and without firearms.
</p>

<p>
Small though their numbers were, however, and
in spite of their imperfect training, Challis had no
reason to be dissatisfied with the spirit of his men.
Before he regained the bottom of the hill the whole
of his force were already on the spot, so closely and
eagerly had they followed in his footsteps.  Their
ranks were in better order than he had expected,
and he praised them warmly, hoping fervently that
their morale would stand the shock of the imminent
conflict.
</p>

<p>
Losing no time, he drew them up in order of
battle.  With the swamp on his right and the hill
on his left, there was no necessity to protect his
flanks.  Across the space between hill and swamp
he placed a hundred of his pikemen in two ranks
of fifty each.  He had still twenty pikemen&mdash;these
he posted in reserve ten yards behind the rear rank,
to deal with any horsemen who might break
through.  Of these John was placed in charge.
</p>

<p>
Of the sixty spearmen, who had six spears apiece,
he arranged that thirty should advance in front of
the line of pikes, cast their spears, and run back
within the lines for shelter.  The other thirty he
posted in the bushes fringing the hillside, with
orders to remain hidden until the leading ranks of
the enemy had passed, and then to assail the rear
ranks with a fierce shower of spears.
</p>

<p>
And then, having placed his horse behind a tall
bush, he stood, rifle in hand, tense with anxiety,
in the centre of the front rank of his expectant
men.
</p>

<p>
If at that moment he could have been spirited
away to England, he would have been glad.  He
had no liking for the soldier's trade, but here he
was, here he must stand; if there was to be a fight,
it was for liberty and peace.
</p>

<p>
The enemy advanced slowly down the bed of
the stream.  Not until their front ranks turned
the corner of the hill did they become aware that
opposition awaited them.  They then saw a line
of men drawn across the bed of the nullah on their
right, with a white man in the centre.
</p>

<p>
They drew rein for a moment to take stock of
the little force opposed to them.  Realising how
small it was, they burst into mocking shouts and
charged.  Challis had hoped for nothing better,
knowing that spears were no match for firearms.
</p>

<p>
He blew his whistle.  Fifty more pikemen
trooped out from the bushes on the right, and
formed a second line behind the first; twenty
ranged themselves in a third line.  Then, before
the jeering horsemen had covered half the distance
between the two forces, they saw themselves
confronted by a triple line of bristling pikes, a kind
of obstacle to which they were unaccustomed.
</p>

<p>
But they did not check their charge.  Galloping
on with furious shouts, they were within a hundred
yards of the pikemen when a flight of spears from
their left hurtled among their ranks.  Carried on
by their impetus, the horsemen dashed upon the
pikes outstretched across their front.  In some
cases the riders, in others the unfortunate horses,
were the victims.
</p>

<p>
Some penetrated the first line and the second,
only to find still a third awaiting them.  Meanwhile
their comrades in the rear had been assailed by
another shower of spears, and, led by Challis, the
pikemen whose weapons had not been broken by
the charge pressed forward on the now wavering
ranks.
</p>

<p>
Then the thirty spearmen on the hill came into
action, darting out upon the rear of the Tubus,
hurling their spears, and following up with a charge.
Assailed in front, flank, and rear, the Tubus lost
heart, pulled their horses round, and galloped away
in the only open direction, towards the stream.
</p>

<p>
Crowding one upon another in their haste, many
of them urged their horses on to the swamp,
unaware of its treacherous surface until the animals
began to sink.  Then the men sprang from the
saddles in fright, abandoned horses, arms, food, and
rushed headlong away, to escape the spears of their
pursuers.
</p>

<p>
It was just at the moment when the flight began
that the victors temporarily lost their leader.
As one of the Tubus was wheeling his horse, he
dealt a sweeping cut with his scimitar at the
pikeman standing next to Challis in the line.  Challis
threw up his rifle and intercepted the blow, which
drove a deep dent into the barrel.  The force of
the impact caused him to stagger against the horse's
flank; he was thrown to the ground, and the horse,
galloping off, dealt him a kick with one of its hind
hoofs.  His pith helmet was flattened on his head.
It saved his life, but he lay stunned where he fell.
</p>

<p>
When he came to himself, he found John bending
over him, with a score of the negroes in a silent,
anxious group behind.
</p>

<p>
"Where are they?" were his first words.
</p>

<p>
The negroes shouted with joy when they saw
that the man who had taught them "medicine"
was still alive.  John pointed to the swamp.
</p>

<p>
"Ober dere, sah," he said.  "Bad fellas all
gone smash."
</p>

<p>
Challis raised himself on his elbow.  He saw
struggling horses, dismounted Tubus, some fleeing
over strips of firm ground, others plunging deeper
into the morass, with the victorious negroes
swarming around them.
</p>

<p>
"Enough!" cried Challis, anxious to avoid
slaughter now that his object was achieved.
</p>

<p>
He blew a shrill blast on his whistle.  Most of
the men turned and came hastening towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Bring off the rest, John," he said.  "They are
not to fight any more.  Get ropes and save the
wretches who are sinking in the bog."
</p>

<p>
The fighting ceased.  Some of the negroes took
ropes, hurled them towards the struggling Tubus,
and hauled them to dry land.  The prisoners
expected to be butchered, the rescuers to be ordered
to slay them.  Both were equally surprised when
John, at Challis's command, shouted that the Tubus
were to be spared.  The negroes could not
understand why mercy should be shown to a merciless
enemy, but Challis saw gladly that they obeyed him.
</p>

<p>
"Take them near the cave, and set a guard
over them," he said.  "We will teach them another
sort of medicine."
</p>

<p>
Rising painfully, he surveyed the field.  Some
sixty Tubus would hunt no more slaves, burn no
more villages.  Many horses had been captured,
together with swords, firearms of various kinds,
and ammunition.  The victory had been won at
small cost.
</p>

<p>
Challis ordered that the wounded Tubus should
be treated exactly like those of his own force.
Then, feeling sick and dizzy, but proud of his men,
and rejoicing in the success of his first blow for
liberty, he went back to the cave, amid lusty shouts
from the warriors and shrill cries from the women
and children.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br /><br />
THE DISCOVERY OF RABEH'S HOARD
</h3>

<p>
Royce spent several hours of the night of his
discovery of Goruba's second entry in cudgelling
his brains over his new problem.
</p>

<p>
Twice had Goruba made his way into the fort;
twice had he escaped.  Yet on neither occasion
had anyone seen him on the ramparts, nor had
anyone seen him in the interior except Challis
and the man who had now been wounded.
</p>

<p>
What puzzled Royce almost as much as the secret
of Goruba's means of entry and of exit was the fact
that he seemed to make no use of it.  Being able
to get in and out without being observed, why did
he not make use of his power, and lead his followers
into the fort?
</p>

<p>
"I wish Tom were here!" thought Royce.  "I
feel like Robinson Crusoe before he had Friday to
talk to.  John is the only Hausa at all equal to
Friday.  I almost wish they had not gone."
</p>

<p>
Next morning he set the men again to work on
the ditch, and went through the fort from corner
to corner, searching for some secret passage.  The
gaps in the walls had all been filled up.  The stone
slabs of the floor all seemed to be solid; none of
them gave forth a hollow sound when he stamped
on them.  At the bottom of the well the spring
bubbled constantly, the overflow passing away
through a narrow slit through which a rabbit could
hardly have crawled.
</p>

<p>
"It beats me altogether," he said to himself
after his thorough survey.
</p>

<p>
He walked round inside the wall to see how the
men were getting on with the ditch, and came to
the foot or two of brickwork which had been
uncovered.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder!" he exclaimed, as a sudden thought
struck him.  "Gambaru, fetch me the spade."
</p>

<p>
When the man returned, Royce began to dig
away the earth on each side of the brickwork,
which was itself too hard and to firmly imbedded
to be cut into or prised up by the only tools he
possessed.
</p>

<p>
He found, after some little time, that the brick-work
was about four feet wide and very deep, and
that it extended inwards.  Dropping the spade,
he walked into the fort in the same straight line
as the brickwork.
</p>

<p>
"This may be the clue," he thought with some
excitement.  "At any rate, I must see."
</p>

<p>
The direction of his walk led him straight to the
well.
</p>

<p>
"A false scent," he said to himself, more puzzled
than ever.
</p>

<p>
He went back to the ditch, to make sure that he
had not been mistaken in his course.  No; there
was no doubt, about it; he felt sure that if he
uncovered the brickwork completely it would end
at or near the wall of the well.
</p>

<p>
Just as he was beginning to dig again, another
idea occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
"It would take me a couple of hours to clear all
the earth away," he thought.  "Perhaps it would
be waste labour.  I'll have another look at the
well."
</p>

<p>
He returned, Gambaru following, much puzzled
at his master's strange proceedings.
</p>

<p>
Standing on the brink, he peered down into the
well, which was wide and fairly light.  He had seen
nothing extraordinary about it when he supervised
the clearing out of the rubbish; there was nothing
extraordinary about it now.
</p>

<p>
In the walls there were rusty iron staples,
intended as footholds, and so used by the men.  He
descended, examining the walls and the staples;
there was nothing strange about them.
</p>

<p>
"The brickwork is just about six feet below
the surface," he thought.  "I'll measure the same
distance here."
</p>

<p>
At a little more than his own height below the
ground he scrutinised the masonry carefully.  There
were slight clefts where the separate stones met, but
nothing unusual in their appearance.  He pushed
and strained at the stonework, without effect.
</p>

<p>
Then he noticed, just within arm's reach to his
right, a staple quite out of line with the rest.  It
seemed to have been fixed in the wall without
purpose.  Leaning over, he pulled at it, at first
cautiously, then more and more vigorously.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-185"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-185.jpg" alt="GAMBARU IS AMAZED" />
<br />
GAMBARU IS AMAZED
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he felt a shock of surprise.  Was the
staple moving, or was he himself?  He planted his
foot firmly on the staple on which he was standing,
and still pulled.  There was no doubt about it;
he was slowly swinging round.  The huge slab of
stone against which he was supporting himself had
moved inwards on his right, outwards on his left,
and he was turning with it.
</p>

<p>
Now thoroughly excited, he tugged steadily, and
in a few moments found himself looking into a dark
aperture in the wall.
</p>

<p>
"Eureka!" he exclaimed joyfully, and Gambaru,
leaning over the brink of the well above,
gasped with terrified amazement as he saw his
master disappearing.
</p>

<p>
"A candle!" shouted Royce.
</p>

<p>
The Hausa sprinted away, and returned with the
whole garrison at his heels.
</p>

<p>
"Back to your places, you idiots!" cried Royce.
"Kulana, keep them at their posts.  Give me the
candle, Gambaru."
</p>

<p>
Holding the lighted candle, he stepped from the
staple into a low dark passage, and groped his way
stoopingly along it.  For some forty or fifty yards
it was narrow; then all at once it opened into a
huge natural cavern, warm and stuffy, with an
earthy smell.
</p>

<p>
Royce looked about him and gasped with
astonishment.  The candlelight fell on an enormous
store of elephants' tusks, huge and massive objects
ranged in close-packed rows, and filling nearly
three parts of the cavern.
</p>

<p>
"My word!  What a find!" Royce exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
He began to count the tusks, came to a hundred,
and gave it up.
</p>

<p>
"Five hundred, at a guess," he thought.  "They
must be worth a fortune.  No wonder Mr. Goruba
wanted to strangle me! ... What's that yonder?"
</p>

<p>
He went farther into the cavern.  Beyond the
tusks lay an assortment of many things&mdash;ivory
cups, vessels of gold, an old French musket, swords,
scimitars, a kepi or two, a French officer's sash,
some cartridge cases, several native spades and
pickaxes&mdash;and, at the far end, objects which caused
him to recoil.  They were human skeletons.
</p>

<p>
At this gruesome sight Royce felt that he had
had enough for the moment.  The air was stifling,
rendered still worse by the smoky candle.  He
retraced his steps, stood firmly on the staple in the
slab, and this time pushing at the other staple,
caused the stone to revolve on its pivot and set
flush with the wall.
</p>

<p>
"What does it all mean?" he thought, as he
sat in his room above, eating the frugal dinner
which Kulana brought him.
</p>

<p>
He remembered what the old chief had told him
about Goruba&mdash;that he had been lieutenant of
Rabeh, the extraordinary negro who had risen from
the position of a slave to the lordship of a great
territory in the Sahara, tyrannised over the natives,
and long defied the efforts of the French to put him
down.
</p>

<p>
Was this secret hoard of wealth Rabeh's?  Had
he stored it in this cavern in the side of the hill,
hoping some day, when he had defeated the French,
to dispose of it?
</p>

<p>
"That must be the explanation," Royce concluded.
"I don't know anything about the ivory
trade, but those tusks must be of immense value,
and must have represented a vast fortune even to
a potentate like Rabeh.  I suppose he let Goruba
into the secret.  When he was killed and his empire
broken up, Goruba was for years a fugitive, the old
man said.  But he was ambitious, like his master.
He always meant to get hold of this treasure.
What Rabeh had done, he thought he could do.
No doubt he joined the Tubus because their country
is near this fort, and has gradually made himself
a power with them.  That's why he comes on his
lonely visits&mdash;to see that Rabeh's hoard is safe.
I don't suppose the Tubus know anything about it.
It wouldn't suit his plans to inform them until he
has made himself their absolute master."
</p>

<p>
Then his thoughts turned in another direction.
</p>

<p>
"How many villages were sacked, how many
thousands of poor wretches were killed or enslaved
in the gathering of this hoard?  And Goruba is
like his master in that, too&mdash;he is the same
blood-thirsty tyrant and oppressor.  But, please God,
Tom will give him a shake.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! those skeletons&mdash;how did they come there?"
</p>

<p>
He pondered for a time without arriving at a
conclusion.
</p>

<p>
"I see!" he said to himself at last.  "They are
the skeletons of the poor slaves who dug the passage
Rabeh killed them to preserve his secret.
Horrible! ... But I haven't discovered everything yet.
Where is the entrance at the other end, by which
Goruba reaches the cavern?  I must go again&mdash;but
not to-day.  I can't face those skeletons again
to-day; to-morrow, perhaps."

CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><br />
GORUBA IS CAUGHT
</h3>

<p>
On the morning after his discovery of Rabeh's
hoard, Royce made a second visit to the cave to
search for the exit which he felt sure must lead to
the outer air.
</p>

<p>
Carrying a lighted candle, he walked slowly round
the walls, examining them carefully.  They appeared
to be in their natural state&mdash;rough, irregular,
knobby, but with no hole or gap large enough to
admit a man.
</p>

<p>
Then he tried the floor.  It consisted of slabs
of stone.  He tapped them here and there, but
they gave no hollow ring; apparently they were
solid.  The ivory tusks were ranged in such orderly
rows that it seemed hardly likely the entrance was
beneath them.
</p>

<p>
Puzzling over what to do next, he suddenly
thought of testing the place with the candle flame.
If there were an opening, there must be a current
of air.  He returned to the slab in the wall of the
well and closed it as tightly as was possible from the
inside; then placed the candle at several spots on
the floor of the cave, one after another, and, retiring
to a distance, watched the flame for signs of
flickering.
</p>

<p>
But he had no success; the flame only flickered
in the current caused by his own movements.
</p>

<p>
"Where can the entrance be?" he said to himself.
"The air is stuffy, but not foul.  I'll try the
passage."
</p>

<p>
He tapped the wall on each side; no sound
rewarded him.  Then he placed the candle on the
floor near the threshold of the cave, and ejaculated
"Got it!" when he saw the flame flicker gently.
Hastening to the spot, he knelt down and passed
his hand slowly over the slabs, and felt a distinct
though slight draught at the seam between two of
them.
</p>

<p>
He pushed at each of the slabs.  They did not
move.  He got up, and jumped on them as forcibly
as the low roof allowed, still without effect.  Then,
lifting the candle, he examined the walls.
</p>

<p>
At his left hand, near the roof, was a single staple,
like those in the wall of the well.  It could not be
intended for climbing&mdash;what, then, was the use of
it?  Standing under it, he grasped it and pulled.
It did not yield.  Then he pushed, more and more
forcibly.  The staple did not move, but he fancied
that the slab on which he was standing sank a little.
</p>

<p>
Looking down, he saw, just below the floor, a
narrow jutting ledge of rock.  With his left foot
on this, he pushed at the slab with his right, still
shoving at the staple with his hand.  The stone
began to revolve, slowly, with a slight grinding
sound.  Presently it stood upright in the middle of
the passage, and moved no more.
</p>

<p>
Royce now saw beneath him half a dozen steep
steps leading down into gloom.  He descended
carefully, lighting his way with the candle, and
found himself in a passage, narrower than the upper
one, but much cooler and less stuffy.  From the
direction of the cave there was a steady draught.
</p>

<p>
Moving against it, Royce, after about fifty paces,
caught sight of a glint of light ahead.  He pressed
on eagerly, and discovered that the passage ended
in an opening roughly circular in shape, about a
yard in diameter.  Passing on, he came out into
a tangle of brushwood through which he saw trees.
He forced his way forward, and stood in a clump
of woodland.  There was nobody to be seen, no
sound.  He stole cautiously among the trees until
he came to the edge of the clump.  It looked over
open country.  Glancing round, taking care to
keep hidden from observation, he saw at last the
fort, on the hill about two hundred yards away.
</p>

<p>
"This must be the clump we noticed," he
thought.  "Now I understand why Goruba has
not used it for cover in attacking us.  He doesn't
want any of his men to discover the secret entrance
to his hoard.  Of course, with the slab down they
couldn't find the hoard itself, but evidently he
doesn't mean to be bothered with inconvenient
questions.  Well, Mr. Goruba, I have caught you
out.  I only wish I could catch <i>you</i>."
</p>

<p>
Royce made his way back quickly, feeling that
he was perhaps risking a good deal in leaving the
men so long.  He carefully replaced the two slabs,
ascended the wall of the well, much to Kulana's
relief, and, having assured himself that the garrison
were at their posts and that the enemy had made
no move, he sat down to devise a trap for Goruba.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose the fellow will come again," he
thought.  "Why does he come at all?  A visit
to the cave and no farther would prove that his
treasure is safe.  I suppose his idea in penetrating
right into the fort is to spy, perhaps to frighten the
men into deserting me.  I mean to stop your little
game, my man."
</p>

<p>
His first notion was to place a couple of sentries
in the cave, to catch Goruba on his next appearance.
In the darkness the giant would not see them.  But
he soon gave that up.  It would probably be better
not to let the men know anything about the cave
for the present.  Besides, he could not tell when
Goruba would pay his next visit, and the superstitious
negroes would never endure a long wait in
the dark.
</p>

<p>
After long puzzling, Royce hit on a plan that
seemed likely to be successful.  He attached a thin
cord to the slab in the well, at a point where it
would not be seen in the semi-darkness by any one
entering from the passage.
</p>

<p>
Carrying the cord round the well, he passed it
through hooks of his own devising&mdash;nails driven into
the brickwork and bent almost double.  At the top
he fastened similar hooks to the wall of the
well-yard, near the floor, drew the cord through them,
and finally tied it to the topmost of a short column
of empty meat tins in his own room.
</p>

<p>
When this was done, he went down to the well
again, turned the slab gently on its axis, and in a
moment or two heard a slight clatter as the tins
were overturned.
</p>

<p>
"I call that a stroke of genius," he said to
himself.  "The question is, will the sound scare Goruba
away?  He is bound to hear it, though it is not so
loud as I expected.  But, after all, there is nothing
to make him connect the sound with his own movements,
so I fancy there will be a little surprise in
store for him."
</p>

<p>
At dusk that evening he sat in his room, watching
the pile of tins, and waiting eagerly for the alarm
signal.  But it did not come.  All night he remained
awake, unable to sleep from excitement.  Not a
sound broke the stillness.
</p>

<p>
Next evening he took up his post at the same time.
Tired and sleepy, he was just falling into a doze
when the tins fell with a crash that made him jump.
</p>

<p>
Pulling off his boots, he slipped very quietly
into the well-yard and stooped below the top of
the wall.  He knew that he was in plenty of time,
for the intruder was sure to move slowly and with
caution.
</p>

<p>
With his electric torch in his left hand and his
revolver in his right, he passed round to the side of
the well opposite to where the staples were placed.
In a few seconds he heard a slight rustle; the man
was climbing over the coping of the well.  He saw
his form, a huge black shape against the dark blue
sky.
</p>

<p>
The man stood listening for a moment, then crept
towards the doorway leading to Royce's quarters.
Royce stole on tiptoe after him, and just as he
reached the opening pressed the button of the torch.
The negro turned instantly, and the bright ray from
the torch flashed upon the startled eyes of Goruba.
</p>

<p>
Royce had expected astonishment, even dismay.
He was not prepared for the extraordinary readiness,
decision, presence of mind with which the negro
would act.  Without an instant's hesitation, Goruba
sprang at him with uplifted knife.  Royce fired,
but either he missed or there was no stopping power
in the bullet, for in another fraction of a second he
was hurled back towards the well, narrowly escaping
toppling over the coping into its depths.
</p>

<p>
But if Royce missed, so did Goruba, dazzled,
perhaps, by the light of his torch.  His knife crashed
on the coping, and was shivered to pieces.  Next
moment Royce found himself for the second time
locked in the giant's embrace.
</p>

<p>
Exerting all his strength, he strove to prevent
the negro from hurling him into the well.  He
shouted.  Answering shouts came from the men.
And then he discovered, to his surprise, that Goruba
was not so formidable an antagonist as when they
had first met.  His grip was not so firm; all the
pressure came from his left arm.
</p>

<p>
Encouraged by this, Royce grappled him closely,
tried a back-throw he had learnt in jiu-jitsu, and
had Goruba on his back as the Hausas, headed by
Kulana, came shouting into the yard.
</p>

<p>
Royce was only just in time to prevent them from
plunging their knives into the struggling negro.
At his order, they tied him up with cords, so tightly
that he howled with pain.
</p>

<p>
"Loosen them!" cried Royce.  "Don't hurt him."
</p>

<p>
Kulana stared.
</p>

<p>
"Him hurt massa," he protested.  "Him fit
for kill all same."
</p>

<p>
"No; that's not our way," said Royce firmly.
"We've got him, and we'll keep him safe.  I hope
this is the end of our troubles."
</p>

<p>
The Hausas, grumbling sullenly, carried Goruba
into the passage next to Royce's room, and laid
him against the wall.  It was then found that his
right wrist was sprained.
</p>

<p>
"He must have struck it against the wall when
he missed me and smashed his knife," thought
Royce.  "That accounts for his feebler grip."
</p>

<p>
To the further disgust of his men, he bound a
wet rag tightly round Goruba's wrist.
</p>

<p>
"Now for a good night's rest for once," he
thought.  "We shall not be attacked to-night, at
any rate."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><br />
A FIGHT WITH CROCODILES
</h3>

<p>
In the afternoon after the fight with the Tubus,
Challis was reclining on a moss-covered rock near
the cave&mdash;he could not endure the atmosphere of
that close-packed habitation.
</p>

<p>
He was thinking things over, wondering whether,
after his first victory, he dared lead his men
towards the fort to encounter the main body of the
enemy under their redoubtable leader Goruba.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he was aware of some excitement
among the crowd of natives just beyond the mouth
of the cave.  Could the Tubus be returning to the
attack?
</p>

<p>
He sprang up, intending to reassure himself on
this point.  But at this moment John came running
towards him, his broad face contorted by a grin.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, John?" Challis asked.
</p>

<p>
To his surprise John burst into loud laughter,
slapping his thighs, bending his body, now and then
pointing towards the swamp and doubling with
laughter again.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, what is the joke?" asked Challis.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my!  Oh, dear!  Oh my lawks!" spluttered
the Hausa.  "Ober dar, sah, ober dar."
</p>

<p>
"Well?  Stop laughing, and tell me about it."
</p>

<p>
John controlled himself with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"Ober dar, sah, two bad fellas!"  A guffaw.
"Tubus, sah.  Up a tree, sah."
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing very funny about that."
</p>

<p>
"No funny?  Oh my lawks!  Up a tree, sah&mdash;no
come down.  Boys frow spears, sah.  Berry
funny, all same."
</p>

<p>
"This won't do," thought Challis.  "I suppose
the Tubus got away, and the men are trying to
spear them instead of taking them prisoners.  But
it's strange.  There was plenty of time for them to
escape altogether when I called the men off.  Why
didn't they run away?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No can do, sah," replied John, laughing again.
"Crocodiles wait for dinner."
</p>

<p>
"Goodness!" Challis ejaculated.  "Are there
crocodiles in the swamp?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, sah! fousand hundred," answered
John.  "Sah come and see.  Him laugh all
same."
</p>

<p>
He preceded Challis towards the swamp, to which
the whole population of the cave were now flocking
like children running to see a Punch and Judy show.
</p>

<p>
Challis hurried on.  Arriving at the edge of
the swamp he saw, about two hundred yards
away, two Tubus crouched in the branches of a
low bushy tree, not five feet above the surface.
</p>

<p>
A number of the spearmen had gone forward
as far as they dared on the spongy ground, and
were gleefully hurling their spears at the negroes.
The range was too long, however; the weapons fell
short, and splashed into the water.
</p>

<p>
And then Challis saw that for some distance
around the tree the swamp was almost like a lake.
The water was evidently several feet deep.  And the
terrified Tubus, clinging to the branches of the tree,
were gazing with horror at the snouts of half a dozen
crocodiles which formed a half circle projecting a
few inches above the surface.
</p>

<p>
Challis was almost as much horrified as the Tubus
themselves.  He knew the cunning and treacherous
nature of the hideous beasts.  He knew that usually
they came upon their prey by stealth.  It was a
surprise to him to find that they were bold enough
to attack men openly.
</p>

<p>
It was clear that the hapless negroes were
hopelessly imprisoned.  In the tree they were safe,
but they could not descend and attempt to swim
away without the certainty of falling victims.  And
the cave dwellers crowding at the edge of the swamp
laughed with delight at their enemies' plight and,
yelled with disappointment when the weapons of
the spearmen fell short.
</p>

<p>
"Stop that!" cried Challis to John.  "Tell
them I am very angry with them for wasting their
spears."
</p>

<p>
John shouted to the men, who shamefacedly
drew back.  They felt no shame at trying to kill
a helpless enemy, but dreaded the wrath of the
white medicine man.
</p>

<p>
"I must save the wretches," thought Challis.  He
meant to break the power of the Tubus if he could,
for the sake of all the natives of the district; but
he could not stand by and see two helpless men
swallowed by these slimy monsters.
</p>

<p>
It was clear that they could not save themselves.
The hungry crocodile is pertinacious; he will not
leave his expected prey.  Some time or other the
men would fall off the tree from sheer terror or
weakness into the very jaws of the reptiles.
</p>

<p>
Challis gazed across the swamp.  The people,
seeing that he did not share their merriment, fell
silent, and watched him curiously.
</p>

<p>
The swamp was covered in patches with aquaceous
plants; there was no other tree except that in
which the negroes had taken refuge.  It would be
useless to fire at the reptiles.  Only the tips of their
snouts were visible; Challis could not be sure of
hitting a vulnerable part.  He tried a shot, but, as
he expected, it had no other effect than to startle
the crocodiles for a moment; the next, when the
sound had died away, their snouts bobbed up
again.
</p>

<p>
On the hillside behind the cave there grew a few
small trees.
</p>

<p>
"John," said Challis suddenly, "take some men
up the hill, cut down a dozen strong young trees,
strip off the leaves, and bring the trunks here as
quickly as you can, with plenty of creepers."
</p>

<p>
John started off with a band of men.  The rest,
excited at the prospect of seeing more big medicine,
chattered noisily.
</p>

<p>
When the men returned, Challis set them to
lash the saplings together with the creepers to form
a raft.  In half an hour it was completed.  At his
order they carried it to the verge of the yielding
ground.  The crowd, having an inkling of his
purpose, shouted with delight.  The white man,
they thought, was going to bring back the Tubus
to be slaughtered.
</p>

<p>
It was difficult to launch the raft from the soft
boggy ground.  The men shrank from entering the
water.  John explained that crocodiles had been
known to snap up a man from the midst of a large
party.  To reassure them, Challis ordered some of
the spearmen to stand by, and watch for the beasts
while their comrades hauled the raft into the
water.
</p>

<p>
When it was at last afloat, he wanted four men
to paddle it.  But when John selected four strong
fellows and told them what they were to do, they
yelled with fright, and fled back among the
crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we must do it ourselves," said Challis.
</p>

<p>
"All same, sah," said John.
</p>

<p>
But Challis noticed that he looked very uneasy.
Only the desire to "show off" before the people
prevailed over his fear.
</p>

<p>
The two got upon the raft, and standing well
in the centre, poled out with saplings across the
thick weedy water.  Challis felt somewhat anxious
himself when he realised how frail and crazy was
this rapidly made raft.  And they had only gone
about fifty yards from the shore when he got some
notion of the nature of the adventure on which he
had embarked.
</p>

<p>
Almost without a ripple on the surface a snout
emerged from the water a few yards ahead of them.
In another moment a second and yet a third
appeared.  Then more came on each side and
behind.  The swamp seemed to be swarming with
the reptiles.
</p>

<p>
Challis tried another shot.  The snouts instantly
disappeared, emerging again, however, after a few
seconds, at a little greater distance.  Whether
Challis had killed one he did not know.
</p>

<p>
He was taking aim for a third shot when the
raft, neglected by John, intent on watching his
master, lurched against a half submerged bank of
weed.  Challis staggered, and in catching at John
to steady himself, dropped his rifle, which struck
the side of the raft and fell into the water with a
big splash.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Challis, trying cheerfully
to hide his annoyance.  "They can't get to us on
the raft."
</p>

<p>
Coming into deeper water, they used the saplings
as paddles.  The crocodiles kept at a greater
distance, but they followed the raft, swimming slowly
and quite noiselessly after it as it crept towards the
tree.
</p>

<p>
Challis felt the presence of this escort not a
little disconcerting.  He was not scared, but
uncomfortable.  He thought of driving off the
reptiles by shouting; it was quite an effort to find
his voice.  When he shouted and splashed with
his paddle there was a momentary scattering and
disappearance of the snouts; but as soon as he
left off, they came up behind and around the raft
again.
</p>

<p>
He was heartily glad when at last they reached
the tree.
</p>

<p>
"Tell the Tubus to come down," he said to John.
</p>

<p>
The Hausa jabbered to the men in the tree; they
neither moved nor answered.  He shouted to them
again, still without effect.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty silly chaps," he said scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they think we shall kill them," said
Challis.  "Tell them we have come to save
them."
</p>

<p>
It required a great deal of eloquence on John's
part before the negroes were convinced that the
white man wished to save, not to take their lives.
Even then they hesitated from fear of the crocodiles.
To encourage them John beat the water noisily
with his paddle, all the time abusing them as "silly
chaps."
</p>

<p>
At last they lowered themselves cautiously from
the branches and stood clinging to each other in
the centre of the raft.  The crocodiles hovering
round seemed to be conscious that their prey was
escaping them, or, as Challis thought, felt that
their dinner was assured, for they made a sudden
dash at the raft.  Some of them got their snouts
over the edge, and while Challis and John
belaboured them with their paddles, the Tubus fell
on their knees and crouched howling.
</p>

<p>
The crocodiles sank into the water, and Challis
and his man began to paddle shoreward with all
their energy.  But soon the reptiles, finding that
they were none the worse for their battering, the
blows of the paddles being but flicks on their
tough hides, returned to the attack.
</p>

<p>
This time the danger was more serious.  The
slight raft rocked about and dipped at the rear
as Challis and John smote desperately with their
poles at the crocodiles, some of which had pushed
their snouts and forelegs over the edge.  The
Tubus, who might have maintained the balance
by going to the other end, cowered and howled
in the middle.
</p>

<p>
Challis and his man had to withdraw from the
edge in order to avoid being capsized, and the
reptiles scrambled farther on.  John's pole snapped
on the back of the foremost, but he thrust the
splintered end into the monster's eye.  At the
same moment Challis plunged his pole down the
throat of another.  The two strokes were almost too
effective.  The crocodiles slid back into the water,
and Challis had only just time to spring forward
and prevent the raft from overturning.
</p>

<br />
THE FIGHT WITH THE CROCODILES
</p>

<p>
There was a brief breathing space.  The monsters
had disappeared.  But the raft was stationary,
and the poles were gone.  It was impossible to
propel it farther except by paddling with their
hands.  They were beginning to do this, Challis
on one side, John on the other, when both started
back simultaneously as the hideous snouts once
more rose above the surface.
</p>

<p>
The scene had been watched with growing
excitement by the crowd on shore.  Realising
the peril of the situation, some of the men began to
hurl spears at the reptiles, which were again closing
in behind the raft.  This was more dangerous to
the men than to the crocodiles.  One of the spears
fell on the raft.  Challis snatched it up, telling
John to order the men to cease throwing.
</p>

<p>
Three more of the monsters were now scrambling
up, and under their pressure the raft moved towards
the shore.  Challis jabbed his spear at their eyes
and gaping mouths.  He disposed of them one
after another.  But his victory brought
catastrophe.  The third flopped off so suddenly that
before Challis could step forward the raft tipped
up, and all four men were thrown into the
water.
</p>

<p>
The Tubus yelled, John shouted, the people on
shore shrieked.  Challis felt that all was over.
Against these reptiles in their own element he
could do nothing.  He could only swim for it.
</p>

<p>
"Splash with your legs!" he cried to John, who,
like the Tubus, was already striking out vigorously
for land, now only fifty yards away.
</p>

<p>
The spearmen, aghast at the plight of their
white chief, forgot their fears and dashed into the
shallower water to save him, the crowd behind them
yelling frantically.  The tremendous splash, the
din and clamour scared even the monsters.  They
sheered off and sank beneath the surface.
</p>

<p>
In a few moments Challis, slimy with weeds and
green with ooze, was dragged up by his jubilant
followers.  John and the Tubus scrambled on
shore unassisted.  The crowd made a dash for
the latter, but Challis sternly called them off,
ordering John to look after them as prisoners of
war.  And then they all marched back to the cave,
the people shouting and laughing with joy, though
Challis felt by no means like a conqueror.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br /><br />
CHARGED BY RHINOCEROSES
</h3>

<p>
On the day after the fight by the swamp, while
Challis was exercising his men, some of the boys
whom he had turned into scouts ran in with the
news that a band of fifty or more armed negroes
was approaching from the south-west.
</p>

<p>
Challis hoped that he would not have to engage
a new enemy.  Giving John orders to watch the
newcomers, he went on with his work.  By and by,
out of the tail of his eye, he saw John talking to
a group of strangers, who looked on at the drilling
with the interest and curiosity of children.
</p>

<p>
It was plain that the newcomers were friends,
and that John, with much self-importance, was
eloquently expounding the virtues of white man's
medicine.
</p>

<p>
When the drilling was over, John announced
that the strangers had heard in their village,
several miles away, of the defeat of the Tubus,
and had come to see the white man who had punished
them.  He further explained that the negroes
wished to join the forces, and learn how to march,
advance, spin round, and use pikes like them.
</p>

<p>
While John was speaking, the scouts signalled
the approach of a smaller band.  Shortly afterwards,
to Challis's amazement, a third party was
announced.
</p>

<p>
It was a striking proof of the extraordinary
rapidity with which news spreads in the wilds of
Africa.  Before the day closed, two or three
hundred men had arrived from widely scattered
villages, all eager to see the white man, and to learn
something of his magic.
</p>

<p>
They were armed for the most part with spears.
Challis saw in them the making of a very respectable
army; but it was clear that, if Royce were to
be relieved, there would not be time to give them
even the very slight training of the earlier recruits.
He did not, however, reject them.  They would
help to make a good show, and might come in
useful, if not to achieve a victory, possibly to
follow it up.
</p>

<p>
Before the night was over he had reason to
doubt the wisdom of his decision.  The new men
belonged to different tribes, and were inclined to
quarrel among themselves.  Challis ordered John
to quarter the various parties separately in the
neighbourhood of the cave, hoping that by keeping
them apart he would prevent disturbance.
</p>

<p>
But a new trouble arose.  One of the bands got
up a war dance around their camp fire, and worked
themselves up to a fury of excitement.  Then,
having learnt the whereabouts of the Tubu
prisoners, they made a rush towards them, and
Challis was only just in time to prevent a wholesale
massacre.
</p>

<p>
The ringleader, who had fairly lost his head,
threw a spear at the Tubus in spite of Challis's
stern command.  It was clear that a lesson was
needed.  Challis doubled his fists, and with two
well-planted blows, left and right, sent the man
spinning.
</p>

<p>
"Tie him up," he said to John, "and keep a
guard over him for the rest of the night.  To-morrow
I shall send him back to his village.  These
people must understand that they must do as they
are told."
</p>

<p>
The fall of their leader sobered the rest of the
band.  They felt a great respect for the white man's
fists, and remained peaceful until morning broke.
Challis was sitting alone, waiting for John to
bring his breakfast.  When the Hausa came up,
he was followed by a group of the negroes, looking
anxious and sheepish.
</p>

<p>
"Silly fellas, sah," said John with a grin.  "Dey
say Umgabaloo berry fine fella, sah.  No want him
to go back."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  He's sorry for himself, perhaps; wants
me to forgive him."
</p>

<p>
"Dat's him, sah.  Just a silly chap.  No savvy
good things like me; no savvy sah knock him
down."
</p>

<p>
Challis could not help smiling at John's notion
of "good things."  He reflected.  It was said that
negroes respected nothing but force; that they
took forgiveness as a sign of weakness.  Would it
be wise to pardon this Umgabaloo, who seemed
popular with his friends?
</p>

<p>
"I'll risk it," he thought.  "Bring Umgabaloo
to me," he said.
</p>

<p>
John fetched the negro, marched him up, and
stood him before Challis, keeping his hand on the
man's neck.  Umgabaloo looked very crestfallen.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him that he's no good to me unless he
can do what he is told," said Challis.
</p>

<p>
John translated this with forcible additions.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him I'll let him off this time if he'll promise
to obey," Challis went on.
</p>

<p>
When John made this announcement, Umgabaloo's
friends shouted, and the man himself tried
to move forward, but was brought up by John's
determined grip.
</p>

<p>
"Does he promise?" asked Challis.
</p>

<p>
"Him say, Sah him father and mother," said
John, "do eberyfing what Sah say."
</p>

<p>
"Very well; let him go."
</p>

<p>
Umgabaloo, released, threw himself at Challis's
feet and poured out a torrent of thanks and
protestations.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if I've done right," thought Challis,
as he dismissed the man.
</p>

<p>
He had decided to make a start for the fort that
day, while the impression made on the enemy was
fresh.  At his orders, every man loaded himself
with four days' provisions from the ample stores
in the cave.  Then he drew up in column the men
whom he had already led to victory, and the
newcomers tried to arrange themselves in similar
formation behind, but were too much excited to
be very successful.
</p>

<p>
Challis had now between three and four hundred
men at his command.  They were still largely
outnumbered by the Tubus; and what was of
still more consequence, they were not so well
armed.  In the recent encounter he had been
able to choose a good tactical position; such a
chance was not likely to occur again.  No doubt,
moreover, the Tubus, warned by their defeat,
would move more cautiously, and, being mounted,
they would take advantage of their mobility to
fight on ground of their own choice.
</p>

<p>
These considerations, and the desire to avoid
bloodshed, influenced Challis's plan.  His object
was to reach the neighbourhood of the fort unobserved,
to communicate with Royce, and if possible
to secure a peaceful withdrawal.  He therefore
decided not to follow either the route by which he
had come, or that taken by the Tubus when they
made their ill-fated attack.
</p>

<p>
As his orderly, John had distributed among the
best of the men the rifles and ammunition captured
from the Tubus.  But Challis commanded them
on no account to use these weapons without orders.
No warning must be given to any Tubus who might
be scouting along the route.
</p>

<p>
All being ready, he went to the head of the column
with a man who knew the country well and would
act as guide.  Then the whole party set off in a
north-westerly direction, to skirt the swamp and
cross the river some distance to the west.
</p>

<p>
The first stage of the march was very difficult.
The negro knew paths across the swamp which a
stranger could hardly have discovered, but even so
progress was slow and laborious.  The men had to
go in single file, sometimes over boggy land close
to the water's edge, keeping a wary eye for
crocodiles; sometimes through rushes as tall as their
heads, from the midst of which they disturbed game
of all kinds, birds and beasts.
</p>

<p>
They had been some two or three hours on the
march, and had got round to the far side of the
swamp, where the ground was drier and firmer,
when Challis saw the guide, some few yards ahead,
suddenly halt and make signs to him to be cautious.
</p>

<p>
Wondering if the Tubus were in sight, Challis
halted the column, ordering the men to be silent,
and walked warily forward.  When he came up
with the guide, the latter pointed to the path about
a hundred yards in front.  And there Challis saw,
not Tubus, but two enormous square-mouthed
rhinoceroses, lying in the mud right across the path.
</p>

<p>
At the moment he caught sight of them the
great beasts scrambled to their feet, turned their
heads in his direction, and snorted.  They had
evidently scented him.
</p>

<p>
Knowing that the rhinoceros is usually a timid
and inoffensive creature, living on herbs, and not a
flesh-eater like the lion, Challis expected the beasts
to sheer off.  But these animals, like other denizens
of the wilds, are sometimes driven into hostility
and aggression by alarm.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of suspense.  Then the
rhinoceroses raised their blunt-horned heads,
snorted again, and came at a lumbering charge
straight for the head of the column.  The guide
shouted and threw his spear, which glanced off the
tough hide of the first, then he uttered a yell and
bolted.
</p>

<p>
Challis had only an instant for making up his
mind what to do.  On one side of the path was
yielding bog, on the other was drier ground, dotted
with bushes.  The path itself was blocked by the
halted column.  He dared not use his rifle, for
fear of giving warning to the enemy.  The leading
rhinoceros was charging straight towards him.
The only chance of safety was to run.
</p>

<p>
He turned and sprinted across the open ground.
The rhinoceros, infuriated by the guide's spear,
swerved off the path and followed him.  Its
companion headed straight along the path.
</p>

<p>
In a few seconds Challis found that the beast,
in spite of its size and unwieldiness, was gaining
upon him.  He darted aside when it was close
behind him, expecting that it would continue in
its half-blind charge.  To his alarm it struck off
almost immediately in his direction.
</p>

<p>
There was no friendly tree in sight.  The
rhinoceros broke through the bushes as if they were
cobwebs.  Challis dodged, first on one side, then
on the other, but the beast showed an alarming
nimbleness.  More than once Challis escaped its
formidable horn only by inches.
</p>

THE RHINOCEROS IN PURSUIT
</p>

<p>
Running on in desperation he stumbled, and had
given himself up for lost when he was conscious of
a diversion.  A dark form, running with extraordinary
speed, dashed obliquely towards him, and
buried a spear deep in the animals' side.  It turned
savagely to deal with this new assailant, who had
darted off at an angle.  For a few yards the
rhinoceros followed him, then it staggered, made
a vain effort to recover itself, and fell a huge heap
upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
The negro rushed back, plucked out his spear,
and driving it again into the quivering beast dealt
it a death-blow.  Challis went up to him.  Umgabaloo
fell on his knees.
</p>

<p>
"I was right," thought Challis, glowing with
pleasure.  "Any one who says that the negro
knows no gratitude lies."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the column had scattered far and
wide to escape the second rhinoceros, which had
apparently taken fright at the number of men, and
had now disappeared.  It was an hour before the
negroes were collected and the march resumed.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><br />
DISASTER
</h3>

<p>
The capture of Goruba cheered the whole garrison
of the fort.  Curiously enough, it was rather as
the evening visitor who disturbed them than as
the leader of the besiegers that the negroes regarded
him.  No longer would they be worried by the
mysterious intruder.
</p>

<p>
Kulana had, of course, told them about the hole
in the wall of the well.  They were eager to see
for themselves the passage through which the giant
had come, but Royce had forbidden that for the
present.
</p>

<p>
Royce on his part, while glad enough to have
Goruba in his hands, was in some doubt as to how
he could turn that fact to account.  Should he
inform the Tubus or not?  He tried to think the
matter out thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
The Tubus would miss their leader as soon as
morning broke.  What would they do?  No doubt
they would at first simply wonder where he had
gone, and why; but they would expect him to
return and would feel no alarm.
</p>

<p>
As time passed, however, his continued absence
would perplex them.  It was pretty clear that
they knew nothing of the secret passage.  They
might begin to search for him, perhaps supposing
that he had met with an accident.  Not finding
him, they would grow more and more anxious;
the mystery would paralyse them; they might
give up the siege.
</p>

<p>
What would they do if they learnt that he was
a prisoner?  The fact might equally discourage
them; or it might enrage them and spur them on
to a desperate attempt to rescue him.  On the
whole, it seemed better to keep them in ignorance,
so Royce decided to lie low and say nothing.
</p>

<p>
It was important at any rate that the prisoner
should be securely guarded.  Accordingly, when
morning dawned, Royce had him carried to a little
cell adjoining the room where Kulana did the
cooking.  There was a low doorway between the
two rooms, and through this Kulana could keep
his eye on Goruba.
</p>

<p>
Royce had the prisoner tied hand and foot, and
instructed Kulana to give him food and water at
intervals.  Then, to prevent a rescue, he took
some men down the well, through the passage and
cave, and into the tunnel, which he ordered them
to block up at the farther end with stones and
earth.  Thus, if the Tubus in their search for
Goruba should light upon the secret entrance
among the trees, they would see only a mass of
rubbish and probably not pry further.
</p>

<p>
Two days passed.  Goruba was sullen.  He took
his meals in silence under the eyes of three of the
Hausas, who released his hands for a few minutes,
and bound them again when he had finished.
Gambaru bathed his injured wrist, but he expressed
no gratitude.
</p>

<p>
On the third day, however, he broke his silence,
telling Kulana that he wished to speak to the white
man.  Kulana left him for a few moments and
fetched Royce, who was very curious as to what
the big negro would say.
</p>

<p>
He was surprised and amused as Kulana translated.
Goruba, a prisoner, tried to make terms as
though he were a free man, and Royce a captive
in his place!  He said that if he were liberated,
he would allow the white man to leave the country
unmolested.
</p>

<p>
"Cheek!" thought Royce, though he could not
help admiring the negro's spirit.  "Tell him," he
said, "that things are the other way round.  If
his men will give up their arms I will let them all
return across the Yo, but they must promise not
to come raiding any more."
</p>

<p>
Goruba's only answer was a scowl.  He fell back
into his former sullen silence.
</p>

<p>
"I really can't blame him," thought Royce.
"If he went back to the Tubus' country with a
broken force, his chief would probably cut off his
head at once.  Even if he were spared, he would
know that he had lost all chance of securing his
treasure, for which he has no doubt been scheming
for years.  But if he holds on, there's always a
possibility of being rescued by his party.  Goruba
is no fool."
</p>

<p>
Another day passed.  Parties of the enemy had
been seen wandering in different directions around
the fort, but they had not broken up their camps.
It seemed indeed to Royce that their numbers had
increased, and he guessed that a messenger had
been sent back across the Yo to report Goruba's
disappearance, and had brought other Tubus with
him on his return.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Royce was growing more and more
anxious about Challis and about the garrison.
What chance had Challis, he thought, of raising
the district, devastated as it was, against raiders
so strong in numbers and so terrible in reputation?
The prospects of relief from the outside were
desperately slight.
</p>

<p>
Inside, food was running short.  Royce realised
with dismay that he had over-estimated the stock.
He doled it out sparingly to Kulana, whose work
became lighter every day.  Several of the men were
showing signs of weakness, some were scarcely
fit for duty.  Royce was touched by the courage
with which they endured their privations.  Even
the weak did not murmur or complain.  All looked
to him with trust and confidence that he and Massa
Chally would save them.
</p>

<p>
On this day, as Royce made the miserable dole
for the evening meal, he had hard work to appear
hopeful and cheerful.  But he knew that he, at
any rate, must not appear despondent.
</p>

<p>
"We are getting thin, Kulana," he said, with a
smile, "but that gives all the more room for
fattening up by and by, when Massa Chally comes
back."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, sah&mdash;when Massa Chally comes back,"
Kulana repeated.
</p>

<p>
"It will be only a day or two now," Royce went
on, fervently hoping that the future would not
belie him.
</p>

<p>
"Only a day or two, sah," said Kulana.  "Den
we eat lots and lots, get all jolly fat."
</p>

<p>
Royce went to the wall, as he did many times a
day, and scanned the country through his
field-glasses.  But beyond the Tubus' camps there was
nothing to be seen but the vast stretch of open
country, dotted with bush and woodland.  There
were no signs of Challis.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he was startled by cries of alarm within
the fort.  Hurrying in the direction of the sounds,
he was amazed to see a cloud of smoke arising from
the roofless room used by Kulana.  The cook was
at the door, groaning and wringing his hands.
Others were trying to get through the smoke into
the room.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had Royce reached the spot than he
heard new cries and rifle shots from the wall.
Thinking that the Tubus were attacking at last, he
rushed back to deal with the more pressing danger,
leaving the men on the spot to fight the fire.
</p>

<p>
The Hausas at the north-east corner were blazing
away in the direction of the tongue of woodland in
which lay the entrance to Goruba's tunnel.  But
there were no Tubus in sight except a small group
on foot far to the left, who were not attacking,
but had apparently been drawn from their camp by
the sound of firing from the fort.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there was one other.  Looking into the
distance he had at first failed to see a dark figure
nearer at hand, zigzagging down the lower slopes
of the hill.  When at last Royce caught sight of it,
it was disappearing into the wood.
</p>

<p>
"Stop firing!" he cried, recognising that it was
only a waste of ammunition.  "Keep a good look
out."
</p>

<p>
Then he hurried back to deal with the fire,
wondering whether the negro he had seen was a
scout sent up to reconnoitre the fort.
</p>

<p>
The fire, meanwhile, seemed to have burnt itself
out.  The room was still full of smoke, smelling of
roasting nuts and grain.  Royce was seized with
misgiving.  He plunged through the smoke, coughing
and rubbing his eyes.  What he saw filled him
with dismay.  The whole remaining stock of
provisions, except a few tins of beef he kept in his own
room, was blackened and burnt.
</p>

<p>
Running back out of the smoke, he ordered some
of the men to save what was still savable, then
turned angrily to question Kulana, to whose
carelessness he thought the fire was due.  But his
anger was immediately disarmed, Kulana explained
that he had been absent a few minutes,
fetching water from the well for the evening meal.
The fire was quite safe when he left it, but when he
returned the place was in flames.
</p>

<p>
A new suspicion flashed into Royce's mind.
Darting again across the smoke-filled room, he
bent down to look through the opening leading to
the prisoner's cell.  Goruba was gone!
</p>

<p>
Two pieces of broken cord lay on the floor; two
other pieces, charred at one end, were in the
cookhouse.
</p>

<p>
Royce could only guess at the manner of escape.
During these past days Goruba must have been
patiently working his feet loose.  Having freed
them, he had seized the opportunity of Kulana's
absence to crawl into the cook-house, burn the
cord about his wrists at the fire, set fire to the food,
and make his escape in the subsequent confusion.
</p>

<p>
Three or four men at the wall said that a man
had suddenly and without a sound rushed from
behind them, jumped on to the wall, sprung down the
twelve feet to the ground outside, and dashed down
the hill.  They fired as soon as they recovered
from their surprise.  One of them was sure that he
had hit the man.
</p>

<p>
"But he got away," said Royce gloomily.
"And nearly all the food is destroyed."  Inwardly
he added: "What is to become of us all?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap27"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><br />
AN ATTACK IN FORCE
</h3>

<p>
Kulana was doing his best to provide a meal&mdash;the
last!&mdash;for the garrison, when Royce's thoughts
were diverted from their gloomy situation by a
sudden call for action.
</p>

<p>
His look-out men shouted, and rushing to the
wall he saw that the great attack, which he had
so long expected, was being made at last.  The
Tubus, dismounted, were rushing up the hill from
three sides.  Goruba was conspicuous at the head
of the party from the north-east.
</p>

<p>
It was plain that the attack had been arranged.
Probably only Goruba's absence had delayed it.
The three columns were advancing in such a way
that they would reach the fort at about the same
moment, and a fact that for an instant struck
Royce with the chill of dread was that some men
in each party carried short ladders, which during
these days of apparent inaction they had evidently
been constructing in the woods.
</p>

<p>
The situation was one which might well cause
the bravest heart to quail.  The Tubus were two
or three hundred in number; the garrison numbered
only sixty, all suffering from the lack of sufficient
food.  Only fifteen had rifles; most of the Tubus
carried firearms of a sort.  The garrison's greatest
defence was their walls, and these the enemy were
coming prepared to scale.
</p>

<p>
"But we'll put up a fight," said Royce to himself.
</p>

<p>
He divided his riflemen into three sections, and
posted one at each of the walls so soon to be
assailed.  Behind them he placed the rest of the
garrison, of whom a few had spears, the remainder
being armed only with stones.  He himself took
up a position on the bastion at the north-east
corner.
</p>

<p>
The Tubus came leaping with immense strides
up the hill.  Royce waited until they were about
two hundred yards away, then gave the order to
fire.  Three volleys flashed forth; some of the
enemy dropped, but their leaders shouted words
of encouragement, and the masses continued to
sweep onward, as a stormy sea surges around an
isolated rock.
</p>

<p>
The Hausas fired steadily at the word of
command, but seemed to make little impression on
the ranks of the Tubus.  If a ladder-bearer fell,
the man nearest to him snatched up the fallen
burden and ran on.  They did not even fire as
they advanced&mdash;partly because the garrison were
covered by the walls; chiefly, no doubt, because
they hoped to overcome the defence by sheer
weight of numbers.
</p>

<p>
Royce felt that the brunt of the attack would
fall on that part of the fort against which Goruba
was advancing in person.  The gigantic negro
seemed to bear a charmed life.  Although he was
bounding up the hill several paces ahead of his
followers, and consequently drew the fire of two
or three of the Hausas, he was untouched, though
some of his men fell at every few yards.
</p>

<p>
With fierce yells the Tubus pressed on.  Hitherto
Royce had taken no active part in the fight,
standing on the bastion and directing the men on
each front.  But now, thinking that if Goruba fell
his followers might lose heart, he drew his revolver
and flashed it at the giant.  He was a good shot
in general, but for some reason or other he missed,
and before he could fire again Goruba was beneath
the wall, hidden from him.
</p>

<p>
In a moment a score of ladders were placed
against the wall on either side of the bastion.
Royce had no doubt that an equal number was
being employed behind him.  The Tubus began
to swarm up.
</p>

<p>
Royce saw that his men had done all that was
possible with rifle fire; they could now only try
to repulse the stormers hand to hand.  He ordered
his men to club their rifles and strike at every
head they saw appear above the walls.
</p>

<p>
For some minutes there was desperate work,
the Tubus striving to make a lodgment on the
walls, the garrison to hurl them back.  At first
the struggle was not unequal.  The enemy could
only mount one by one; while mounting they
could not use their weapons, and the defenders
had the advantage of them in position.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-227"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-227.jpg" alt="GORUBA HAS A BLOW" />
<br />
GORUBA HAS A BLOW
</p>

<p>
Royce waited for Goruba to appear.  When he
saw the massive head rise above the wall he pulled
the trigger of his revolver.  There was no response;
something had gone wrong.
</p>

<p>
Dropping the weapon, he snatched the rifle
from the nearest Hausa and brought the butt
down on Goruba's head with all his force.  The
man fell back among his followers, and Royce
hoped that he had seen the last of him.
</p>

<p>
But he had underestimated the thickness of the
African skull.  For a time he was busy with the
Tubus who had mounted on each side of their
fallen leader, and had just succeeded in clearing
the wall in his neighbourhood when he heard loud
shouts from the wall behind.
</p>

<p>
Turning round, he saw that Goruba had mounted
there and was laying about him with his clubbed
rifle with undiminished vigour.  Royce called to
Gambaru and another man to follow him, sprang
down to the inside of the ditch, and rushed across
the fort.
</p>

<p>
They were just in time to fell two or three
Tubus who had already dropped down from the
wall, tumbled into the ditch, and were struggling
to clamber up.  The other Hausas were gallantly
trying to beat the assailants from their ladders.
The air rang with shouts, mingled with the dull
thuds of the rifles as they fell on heads and shoulders.
Goruba had managed to plant his feet on the
wall, and was about to spring down when Royce
thrust his rifle between the negro's legs and, with
a sudden wrench, caused him to lose his balance.
With a savage yell he fell backwards, and once
more lay prostrate on the ground outside.
</p>

<p>
Reinforced by Royce and his two followers, the
Hausas on their side fought with redoubled fury,
and after a minute's hard fighting cleared the wall.
But the weakening of the defence at his former
post had enabled the enemy to press the attack
there.
</p>

<p>
Leaving some of his men to re-open fire on the
Tubus, if they returned to the assault, Royce
hurried back.  He found that during his absence
the garrison had been driven from the ramparts.
The enemy had drawn up their ladders, and,
jumping down on the inner side, had begun to
throw them as bridges across the ditch, in spite
of the shower of stones which the men there were
hurling at them.
</p>

<p>
Royce called up some men from the western
side, where the attack had failed, and led them
with a ringing cheer upon the flank of the invaders.
Attacked thus from two sides, they gave way and
were driven in a confused mass between the wall
and the ramparts towards the bastion on which
Royce had recently posted his riflemen.
</p>

<p>
Seized with panic and deprived of their leader,
the Tubus tried to clamber up the wall.  Some
few succeeded, the greater number were knocked
down with rifles or pulled back by the defenders,
and fell cowering to the ground.
</p>

<p>
Again Royce had to turn back to deal with
another crowd who had taken advantage of his
absence to swarm up on the eastern rampart, from
which they had driven the panting Hausas.  But
the men behind the ditch, seeing that they could
now cast their stones without hitting their friends,
flung the jagged missiles at the enemy just as they
were raising their guns to fire.
</p>

<p>
"Well done!" cried Royce, rushing to their support.
</p>

<p>
This was enough for the Tubus.  Only one of
them managed to fire; then a stone struck him,
and with his companions he leapt from the wall
among the baffled men beneath.
</p>

<p>
Beaten on all sides, the Tubus took to their
heels and fled as fast as they could down the hill
which they had ascended with such confidence a
quarter of an hour before.

CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><br />
THE ELEVENTH HOUR
</h3>

<p>
Challis, having re-formed his column,
disorganised by the rhinoceroses, led it forward at
a brisk pace to make up for lost time.  Two
men who knew the country went in advance as
scouts.
</p>

<p>
The march continued for the rest of the day
without mishap.  At night they encamped on
open ground, lighting no fires, and with sunrise
next morning they were again on foot.
</p>

<p>
Soon after midday John announced that the
fort was about three miles away.  Challis ordered
the men to halt.  Now that they were nearing
the enemy it was necessary to move with great
caution.  Calling the leaders of the various tribes
together, he explained to them, through John,
that he would leave them for a few hours and go
forward alone to reconnoitre the position.  They
were not to move until his return.
</p>

<p>
"Sah not go by himself," said John.  "Me
show way; me savvy all 'bout it."
</p>

<p>
"I think you are right," said Challis.  "I shall
go faster with you as guide.  Come along, then;
let us start at once."
</p>

<p>
They set off across the open country in the
direction of the fort, John's sense of locality making
him a capable guide.
</p>

<p>
Presently they entered an extensive stretch of
woodland, through which progress was slow.  Just
as they reached the farther end of it John started
back suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Tubus, sah!" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
Two Tubus, armed with spears, had just dismounted,
tethered their horses, and entered the
wood.
</p>

<p>
"This is awkward," thought Challis.  "If they
are scouts, they may go far enough to see our men,
or they may see us.  What can we do, John?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Shoot, sah," replied John at once.
</p>

<p>
"That would never do.  The shots would alarm
the enemy.  Besides, I don't care about shooting.
Do you think we could capture them?"
</p>

<p>
John grinned.  The idea pleased him.
</p>

<p>
"If we can manage it," Challis went on, "you
must take them back to our men.  I can find my
way alone now."
</p>

<p>
"Berry fine, all same, sah," said John.  "Me
show sah."
</p>

<p>
He turned back into the wood, moving swiftly
but silently through the undergrowth.  Challis
followed him, noticing that he was taking a
direction away from that followed by the Tubus.  In
a few moments he guessed the reason of this.
John's intention was to get to leeward of the
enemy, as if he were stalking animals.
</p>

<p>
It was nearly half-an-hour before the Hausa
stopped, laid his finger to his lips, and pointed
through the trees.  Challis caught sight of the
two men walking slowly towards them, a few yards
apart, apparently examining the ground.
</p>

<p>
John by signs made his leader understand what
his plan was.  They were to separate and crouch
among the undergrowth, one on each side, until
the men passed; then to spring on them from
behind.
</p>

<p>
Bending low, they selected two large bushes
and lay in wait there.  The Tubus came on
unsuspiciously, but looking keenly around them.
</p>

<p>
Challis was tingling with excitement.  Would
the men see him?  Would they hear the rustle
of his movements?  Would they escape?  If they
did, it seemed that all chance of a secret approach
to the fort would be lost.
</p>

<p>
His man was drawing nearer.  He passed
within five or six yards of the bush.  Then Challis
rose to his feet, gathered himself together, and
made a spring towards the negro.  The man
heard him, turned with a start, and was raising
his spear, when Challis, stooping suddenly, threw
his arms round the Tubu's knees and brought him
to the ground.
</p>

<p>
Almost at the same moment, twenty yards
away, John, as noiselessly as a panther, had leapt
upon the back of the second Tubu and fallen on
top of him.  Depriving the man of his spear, he
was now forcing him to crawl on all fours towards
his prostrate companion, threatening to prick him
with the spear if he made a noise or did not move
fast enough.
</p>

<p>
While Challis kept guard over the men, John
cut from the undergrowth a number of pliant
tendrils.  With these he tied the Tubus' wrists,
and fastened them also neck to neck, telling them,
in their own language, that they were silly fellows.
</p>

<p>
One of them spoke to him sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Yoi-aloo!</i>" cried John, laughing.  "Dey say
Goruba gone lost, sah!"
</p>

<p>
"Lost, is he?" said Challis.  "They were
searching for him, then.  How was he lost?"
</p>

<p>
"Went away, sah," returned John, after questioning
the man.  "No savvy what for.  'Fraid
him gobbled up."
</p>

<p>
"That's good news.  What will they do if they
don't find him?"
</p>

<p>
"Very sad all same, sah.  Dey go back over
Yo; had 'nuff; plenty sick, sah."
</p>

<p>
It was good news indeed that the Tubus had
lost their leader; still better that they were
disheartened and thinking of returning to their own
country.
</p>

<p>
"Well, John," said Challis, "take these fellows
back to our men; then come after me as fast as
you can.  I will go on and see what is happening."
</p>

<p>
John went off, driving the negroes in front of
him.  Challis waited until they were out of sight;
then, going to the edge of the wood, he looked all
around to make sure that no more Tubus were in
sight, and continued his journey, taking cover
from bush to bush.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes he saw the fort on the hilltop
some distance away.  Making a round, he
approached it from the north-west side, stopping
every now and then to listen.  Apparently there
were no Tubus between him and the fort, but he
dared not go too close to it while daylight lasted, for
he would certainly be seen as he mounted the hill.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly he halted in a wooded hollow to
wait for darkness.  He wondered how the little
garrison was faring, whether the Tubus had
attacked, whether they were really on the point
of giving up the siege.  The time passed too
slowly for his impatience, and he longed for the
sun to go down.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, about an hour before sunset, he heard
shouts.  They ceased immediately.  What was
happening?  He stole up the slope of the hollow,
intending to lie flat just below the top and peep
over.  But before he had reached it there were
loud shouts, followed by rapid rifle fire.  It was
clear that the garrison was defending itself against
a fierce assault.
</p>

<p>
When he gained the top of the slope and looked
over, he found that he was still too far away to
see anything clearly.  The attack was not being
made on the side towards which he was gazing.
He was on the point of rushing forward, when he
saw several dark forms running round the base of
the wall.  Though he longed to assist his friend,
it was clear that he could not run the gauntlet
through these armed negroes, and he sank back,
filled with great anxiety.
</p>

<p>
The firing ceased, but the shouts continued for
a time.  Then again there was silence, and he saw
with unspeakable thankfulness that the Tubus had
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"Well done!" he thought.  "It will soon be
dark, and then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
John slipped up quietly behind him.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Royce and his men were resting after
their victory.  Never had a fight been won at so
small a cost.  Many of the men had been injured
by the Tubus' clubbed rifles, some had spear
wounds; but none had been killed, and with care
all the wounded would recover.
</p>

<p>
Royce praised the men for their sturdy defence,
and told them he hoped the enemy would trouble
them no more.  But in his heart he was far from
confident.  An ordinary raiding party of negroes
would long since have abandoned the struggle, but
in Goruba these men had no ordinary leader.  He
had shown himself possessed of exceptional courage
and resource, and&mdash;what is still rarer in the
negro&mdash;resolution.  While he was with them they would
not give up, Royce felt sure.
</p>

<p>
He wished that he could have disposed of
Goruba; but when, after the fight, he mounted the
wall at the point where the giant had fallen and
looked for him, rifle in hand, he was not to be seen.
</p>

<p>
Kulana managed to provide a meal from the
remains of the burnt provisions, but it was the
last.  The men knew it, and though Royce spoke
cheerily, he could see that they were depressed, in
spite of their victory.  Unless relief came, they
would be face to face with starvation if the siege
were maintained, and of relief there was no sign.
</p>

<p>
When darkness fell Royce posted the sentries as
usual, and looked anxiously down the hill to see
whether the enemy were still encamped below.
His hope that they had withdrawn was dashed by
the appearance of their fires in the usual quarters;
they still formed almost a complete ring round
the hill.
</p>

<p>
Reckoning up the chances for the hundredth
time, Royce realised that, although a sally from
the fort might break through the ring, the enemy
would follow them up on their horses and, in the
open country, overwhelm them.
</p>

<p>
"It's no go," he thought with gloomy foreboding.
"Poor old Tom!  What has become of him?"
</p>

<p>
As he sat resting his chin on his hand, Gambaru
came up with two or three of the Hausas.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it?" asked Royce.
</p>

<p>
"Massa Chally nebber come, sah," said Gambaru
in a mournful tone.
</p>

<p>
"Well?  You have something else to say?"
</p>

<p>
Gambaru hesitated for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Food all gone, sah," he began.  "What can
do?  Must eat.  Nuffin to eat.  Boys all die.
All berry hungry, sah."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  We have had little enough all along.
We have now nothing at all.  I am very sorry
for you.  But I want you to wait just one more
day."
</p>

<p>
The men talked among themselves.  Then
Gambaru said:
</p>

<p>
"Boys no want to wait, sah.  Tubus light fires;
no go away.  No more food; how can fight?  Boys
say all go out, run fast."
</p>

<p>
"They would catch us on their horses."
</p>

<p>
"Die all same, sah," said Gambaru.  "No food,
all die; Tubus catch um, all die same.  One way
die slow, other way die quick&mdash;boys say die quick
best."
</p>

<p>
Royce was wandering how he could persuade
the men to wait, even one day longer, when the
bark of a jackal startled them all.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" said Royce, rising in excitement.
"It is Massa Chally at last.  That was John's cry."
</p>

<p>
Some of the men shook their heads and declared
that it was the cry of a real jackal, but
Gambaru and Kulana assured them positively that
it was John's imitation.  They listened silently
for a repetition of the cry.  It had come from a
distance; there was no other sound in the silence
of the night.
</p>

<p>
The whole garrison flocked to the walls and,
holding their breath, peered out into the darkness.
They could see nothing, hear nothing.
</p>

<p>
Minutes passed; hope gave way to disappointment
and despair.  Even Royce himself felt that
he had been mistaken, and the men began to
murmur against Gambaru and Kulana.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly they were startled to silence again
by the cry, repeated softly close under the wall on
the north-west side.  Every one ran to the spot,
even the sentries, and Royce did not send them
back to their posts.  For now, down the slope,
they had caught sight of a dim, dark shape moving
by almost imperceptible degrees towards the fort.
</p>

<p>
"Let down a ladder, Kulana," said Royce,
whispering through parched lips.
</p>

<p>
The Hausa took up one of the scaling-ladders
left behind by the Tubus and lowered it over the
wall.  In breathless silence the watchers saw the
form crawl up to it, set his foot on it, and begin
to climb.
</p>

<p>
Murmurs of excitement burst from the eager crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" said Royce.  Leaning over the wall
he whispered: "Tom?"
</p>

<p>
"Right-o, old boy.  Back at last!" said Challis's
cheery voice.
</p>

<p>
"Massy Chally back!  Massa Chally back!"
cried the negroes, irrepressibly laughing and
shouting with joy.  Royce bade them be silent in vain.
His heart was too full to reprove them.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God, you're back!" he said, giving his
hand to Challis as he reached the top of the wall.
"I had given you up."
</p>

<p>
"Glad I'm in time," said Challis, pressing his
friend's hand warmly.
</p>

<p>
"But where is John?" asked Royce.  "It was
his cry we heard?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  I couldn't have done that.  John
has gone back to my army."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><br />
TUBUS TO THE RESCUE
</h3>

<p>
Together in the inner room of the fort, the
two friends talked long and earnestly.  Royce
related all that had happened during Challis's
absence; the discovery of Rabeh's hoard, the
capture and escape of Goruba, the attack which
had just been beaten off.  He made light of the
garrison's straits for food, and it was some time
before Challis learnt that Goruba's cunning had
destroyed the little that remained.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old chap!" he said.  "Well, we've
brought a little with us, and when we've driven
the Tubus away we shall have the whole country
to forage in."
</p>

<p>
"You spoke of your army," said Royce, "You're
not pulling my leg?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it.  I've got a couple of hundred
fine fellows three or four miles away.  I never
thought I should live to be a drill sergeant!"
</p>

<p>
He explained how he had recruited and trained
his army, and Royce chuckled as he saw in his
mind's eye the first efforts of the negroes to obey
the word of command.
</p>

<p>
Then they talked over their plans,
</p>

<p>
"What I propose is this," said Challis.  "I'll
slip out again presently, get back to my army, and
lead an attack on the Tubus' camp to the north-west
about dawn.  When you hear the rumpus,
make a sortie with your men, and fall on the enemy
in the rear."
</p>

<p>
"But what about the other camps?" asked Royce.
</p>

<p>
"We must tackle them when we have joined
forces," Challis replied.  "I fancy the Tubus are
so unaccustomed to meet organised attack that
they won't put up much of a fight.  At any rate,
I hope they won't, for everybody's sake, though
we shan't have done our work properly unless we
teach them a lesson."
</p>

<p>
"Well, old man, we shall owe a lot to you.
I've wondered and wondered what you were
doing, wished you hadn't gone, feared I should
never see you again; in short&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In short, you're an old ass, so shut up.  You've
had much the harder task in keeping your end up
here.  Now, don't argue, or we shall have to toss
for it, and I won last time."
</p>

<p>
A little later Challis left the fort by the ladder
as he had entered it, and crawled down the hill,
pausing every now and again to listen for signs
of the enemy.  Several times he was deceived by
the movement of bushes stirred by a light breeze.
Once or twice rabbits or other small animals
scurried away almost from beneath him, giving
him a momentary start until he realised the nature
of these harmless disturbances.
</p>

<p>
He reached the foot of the hill, and directed his
course under cover of occasional bushes in a line
between south-west and south.
</p>

<p>
A strange feeling of uneasiness held him, in spite
of his efforts to shake it off.  Though he moved
with the utmost caution, his progress was not so
silent as he could have wished.  Once he stepped
on a dry twig, which snapped with a report that,
in his nervousness, he felt sure must be heard by
the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Not until he had reached the shelter of the
woodland did he breathe more freely.
</p>

<p>
There was now little chance, he thought, of his
being intercepted by the Tubus, whose camp fires
he had left behind him and on either hand.  But
there was always the risk of coming upon some
wild animal, or perhaps a serpent like that which
had disturbed Royce's night's rest in the tree,
and in his watchfulness he strained eyes and ears
painfully.
</p>

<p>
He passed safely through the thin belt of
woodland, and hurried across open ground towards a
thicker belt which he saw looming up before him,
dark in the starlight.  Just as he had come within
about fifty yards of it, there was a slight sound
immediately in his front.  Halting, he heard the
patter of bare feet on both sides, and a number
of figures darted dimly into view from left and
right.
</p>

<p>
And now Challis's training as three-quarter in
his school fifteen stood him in good stead.
</p>

<p>
As the men approached, he sprang forward, just
eluding their attack, swerved to avoid a man right
ahead, and dropped, in time to bring down another
rushing in from his left.  He heard the negroes
colliding and jostling one another in the darkness
as he sprinted towards the trees.
</p>

<p>
They were after him instantly, but he had a few
yards in hand when he plunged into the undergrowth,
heedless of the thorns that tore his hands
and clothes.  The almost naked negroes were
punished much more severely as they rushed in
after him.
</p>

<p>
It was pitch dark in the wood.  Challis ran on
blindly, tearing a way by main strength, or by
doubling and twisting when the obstacles were too
firm to be broken through.  He soon shook off his
pursuers, but it was not long before he recognised
that he was lost in the wood, and his nervousness
returned with double force.
</p>

<p>
Should he go on, or stand still?  If he went on,
he might go farther and farther from his true
course.  If he stood still, he might be stalked by
some wild beast which would probably avoid him
if he were moving.
</p>

<p>
After a little anxious hesitation, he decided to
climb a tree and try to get a rough bearing from
the stars.  When he descended, he pushed on
again.  He knew that the wood was not very
wide.  Beyond it was more or less open country,
over which he thought he could easily find his way
to the spot where his men were awaiting him.
</p>

<p>
Presently he came to a glade, and went more
rapidly, paying less attention to his footsteps, and
peering around for some opening through the rest
of the wood.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the ground seemed to give way beneath
him.  He fell, accompanied by a landslide
of loose earth, and when at last his fall was checked,
he lay for some minutes half-stunned upon the
ground.
</p>

<p>
When he regained his wits, he anxiously felt his
arms and legs.
</p>

<p>
"No bones broken," he thought.  "But I'm
sure I'm black and blue.  And where am I?"
</p>

<p>
Feeling battered and bruised, he got up, shaking
off the mass of earth, leaves, and twigs that had
fallen with him, and began to grope about in the
darkness.  In a moment or two he stumbled over
something hard, which rattled as he kicked it.
He stooped down, and felt with his hand, which
touched a heap of bones.
</p>

<p>
A shudder ran through him, and he recoiled.
"Don't be a silly ass," he said to himself, and
stooped again, taking up one bone after another.
He could not help heaving a sigh of relief.  Such
large bones could never have been the framework
of a human body.  "I'm jiggered," he thought.
"Of course, I've tumbled into an elephant pit.
And how in the world am I to get out?"
</p>

<p>
He knew that elephants were sometimes trapped
in deep pits by the natives, and he had vague
recollections of stories of men who had fallen into
such pits and never got out again.
</p>

<p>
Looking upward, he saw signs of dawn through
the narrow opening.  But within the pit it was
still too dark for him to see the nature of the place
into which he had fallen.  He could only examine
it by the sense of touch.
</p>

<p>
The result of his examination was alarming.
He walked round the pit, testing the walls with
his hand in the hope of finding a place where the
earth had broken away, so that he could climb up.
But he found that the walls sloped inward, like
an inverted cup.  They were quite unscalable.
</p>

<p>
At this discovery he was aghast.  What could
he do?  He was twelve or fifteen feet below the
ground, and though he groped around for objects
with which to make a sort of pedestal, he found
nothing but the elephant's bones.
</p>

<p>
"It's no good getting into a stew," he thought.
"I had better wait until it is light.  Perhaps I'll
see a way out then."
</p>

<p>
He sat down, reflecting that, if there were no
other way, he would have to dig up earth with his
pocket-knife, and make a pillar high enough, if
he stood on it, to enable him to reach the sides of
the hole.  The thought that, even if he succeeded
in this, the earth above might break away in his
hands, made him shiver.
</p>

<p>
In course of time the sky changed from dark
blue to grey, and from grey to light blue.  But
the bottom of the pit was only dimly illuminated,
because the hole was so small.  He saw now,
however, that the bones formed a complete skeleton,
and that a pair of enormous tusks lay imbedded
in moss, leaves, and earth.
</p>

<p>
Clearly the pit had long been disused.  Those
who had dug it had either forgotten it, or more
probably had been killed in Tubu raids.  The
elephant must have met its fate many years before,
for nothing but the skeleton remained.
</p>

<p>
The brushwood originally piled over the opening
was only partially displaced when the elephant
tumbled in, and creepers had grown over what
was left, again concealing the trap.
</p>

<p>
As he became fully aware of the nature of his
position, Challis grew more and more alarmed.  He
pictured himself sharing the fate of the elephant,
starving by inches, and at last his bones lying
with the skeleton on the floor of the pit.
</p>

<p>
His thoughts returned to Royce, waiting in the
fort for the help that never came, and to his army,
a few miles away, becoming more and more uneasy
at the absence of their leader, perhaps quarrelling
among themselves, breaking up and leaving the
white man to his fate.
</p>

<p>
These terrible possibilities spurred him to action.
Seizing one of the bones, he set to work to scrape
at one side of the pit, with the idea of making a
pathway.
</p>

<p>
The earth crumbled away, but was so friable
that his work was like digging in sand; the space
he hollowed out filled as fast as he scraped the
earth away.  Then he thought of driving the bones
into the side to form steps, but the ground gave no
hold sufficient to bear his weight.
</p>

<p>
These failures drove him to despair.  Only one
resource was left&mdash;to shout for help.  His own men
were too far away to hear him; the only persons
within call were probably the Tubus from whom
he had escaped.  But he might as well be killed
by Tubus as die of hunger and thirst in the pit.
Already his mouth was parched through his
exertions and his distress of mind.
</p>

<p>
He shouted again and again, until he was hoarse.
There was no answer.  Waiting awhile, he made
his hands into a trumpet, and shouted still more
loudly up through the opening.  In the hollow
pit the sound was tremendous.  Still no one
replied.
</p>

<p>
Feeling desperate, he seized his bone spade again
and hacked feverishly at the floor.
</p>

<p>
"I must do something," he thought, "or I shall
go mad."
</p>

<p>
With the earth he dug up he began to construct
a pillar.  But he soon realised that it would take
many hours, perhaps days, to raise it to a sufficient
height.
</p>

<p>
Hot, weary, and despairing, he was resting for a
moment when he heard a low hail from above.
He looked up; at one side of the hole he saw a
dark face peering down.  He could not distinguish
the features.
</p>

<p>
Without stopping to consider whether the man
were an enemy or a friend, he called to him, and
he trembled with joy when he heard, in startled
tones, the words:
</p>

<p>
"Massa Chally!"
</p>

<p>
"John!" he cried.  "I can't get out, John."
</p>

<p>
He laughed afterwards when he remembered this
very obvious statement.
</p>

<p>
"Take care," he added.  "We shall both be
lost if you fall in, too."
</p>

<p>
"Oh my lawks!" John ejaculated.  "What for
you go tumble in dat way, sah?  Berry funny all
same."
</p>

<p>
"Not so funny as you think," said Challis.  "You
must get me out.  I've had enough of it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, sah, me savvy.  Half mo, sah."
</p>

<p>
His broad face disappeared.  After some minutes
he returned with an armful of creepers, which he
stripped of their leaves and deftly wound into a
rope.  This he let down into the pit.  Challis tied
it under his arms, and called to John to pull.  But
John, strong as he was, could not haul up a man
of Challis's weight without leverage, as he found
in a very few moments.  There was no convenient
tree within easy reach.  What was to be done?
</p>

<p>
"Wind it round you, and I will climb up," said
Challis.
</p>

<p>
But he had risen only a few feet above the floor
of the pit when John staggered, and Challis let
go and dropped for fear of pulling the Hausa down.
The mishap seemed to tickle John, who laughed
heartily, though Challis found it no laughing matter,
and was all the time uneasy lest the Tubus should
appear on the scene.
</p>

<p>
"Don't stand there grinning like an ape," he
said somewhat tartly.
</p>

<p>
John sobered at once.
</p>

<p>
"Me savvy, sah," he said, and for the second
time he went away.
</p>

<p>
When he came back he was accompanied, to
Challis's astonishment, by the two Tubus whom
they had captured on the previous day.  Lengthening
the rope a little, he wound it tightly round the
two men, who were still tied together, then called
to Challis to climb.

RESCUED BY THE ENEMY
</p>

<p>
In half a minute Challis's head was level with
the brink of the pit.  Then John, telling the Tubus
to move away, grasped his master's hands, and by
dint of the efforts of the three men Challis was
hauled out of his prison.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap30"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
<br /><br />
THE FORWARD MARCH
</h3>

<p>
"How did you happen to be here with the
Tubus?" asked Challis, when he stood beside John.
</p>

<p>
"Nebber let go, sah," said John.
</p>

<p>
"But I told you to take them back to the men."
</p>

<p>
"All same, sah," was John's reply.
</p>

<p>
He seemed unwilling to say more, fearing,
perhaps, a reproof for disobedience.  But Challis
managed to get out of him the explanation that
he had been too anxious about his master's safety
to go far away.  He had left the Tubus tied up
to a tree while he went on to the fort to give his
jackal cry, and on returning to them he had decided
to wait in the forest to make sure that Challis
would come back safely.  At dawn he was stealing
in the direction of the fort when he heard Challis's
cry.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's very lucky that you did disobey,"
said Challis, "and I owe you my life, John.  Be
sure I shan't forget it."
</p>

<p>
"Like to please Massa Chally," John grinned
happily.
</p>

<p>
Anxious to make up for lost time, Challis hurried
back with John and the Tubus to the spot where
he had left his men.  As he expected, they were
becoming restless.  But they gave a great shout
of joy when they saw him in the distance, and
Challis sent John forward to order them to be
silent; for all he knew, Tubu scouts might be in
the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
His intention, as he had arranged with Royce,
was to reach the Tubus' camp north-west of the
fort about sunrise, and he felt that there was grave
risk in leading an attack in broad daylight.  But
the thought of Royce's disappointment, of his
wonder and dismay when the arrangement was
not carried out, nerved him to the task.
</p>

<p>
Impressing on the men that they must march
in perfect silence, he drew them up in an orderly
column, inspected their arms, and moved off at
their head.  Some of the best scouts were thrown
out ahead and on the flanks to guard against
surprise with orders to report at once if they caught
sight of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Challis felt very nervous.  Numbers and arms
were on the side of the Tubus.  He had hoped to
counterbalance this disadvantage by the effect of
a sudden swoop in the early morning twilight, but
that was now impossible.
</p>

<p>
The steadiness of his men, however, at the fight
by the swamp, was of good augury, and their
belief in white man's magic and trust in their
leader were strong.  They were full of courage and
enthusiasm, and seemed confident that the coming
struggle would rid them for ever of the murderous
tyranny of their oppressors.
</p>

<p>
They followed a roundabout course, in order to
take advantage of all the cover afforded by the
numerous clumps of woodland on the western side
of the fort.
</p>

<p>
As they passed through the undergrowth and
trees, they started many flights of birds, which
Challis feared would give warning to the Tubus,
from whom he had so narrowly escaped in the
night.  He was surprised that there was no sign
of them.  Why had they not followed him up, or
at least fetched a body of their comrades to hunt
for him?
</p>

<p>
The explanation, which he only guessed at later,
was that the Tubus had supposed that the white
fugitive was Royce.  They reported this to Goruba,
who jumped to the conclusion that Royce had left
his men in the lurch.  The result of this mistaken
belief will be seen presently.
</p>

<p>
The column thus advanced unmolested and unseen.
After an hour and a half's march, John, who
had gone ahead with the scouts, came back to
announce that they were now in a line with the
fort, which was something less than a mile away.
</p>

<p>
Challis called a halt at the western side, farthest
from the fort, of a patch of scrub.  Once more he
impressed on his men the necessity of silence.  He
told them also that if they succeeded in putting
the Tubus of the north-west camp to flight, they
must not carry the pursuit too far, for they would
then become dispersed and be unable to deal with
the men from the other camps.
</p>

<p>
Wondering doubtfully whether John had made
his meaning clear, he was about to lead his men
on, when a sound suddenly struck his ear.  For
the moment he did not recognise it, but hearing
it again he knew it to be the sound of horses
neighing.  The animals were apparently between
him and the camp.
</p>

<p>
An idea flashed into his mind.
</p>

<p>
"John," he said, "go out ahead and see where
those horses are, how many there are, and what the
Tubus are doing."
</p>

<p>
It was twenty minutes before John returned.
His report was interesting, and would have been
alarming, but for the idea which had occurred to
Challis.
</p>

<p>
About fifty of the Tubus, said John, were about
to ride off in a northerly direction.  Each man
had four or five horses in his charge, so that they
were probably going to a grazing ground somewhere
near.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the men in the north-west camp were
hard at work making ladders.  It was clear that
another attack was to be made on the fort.  The
ladders previously used had been left behind under
the walls.
</p>

<p>
It was clear, too, that the enemy had no suspicion
of any attempt from the outside to raise the siege.
Confident in their numbers, they had taken no
steps to guard against an attack from the rear.
</p>

<p>
"With luck we have them!" said Challis to
himself, and turned to give final orders to his
expectant men.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap31"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI
<br /><br />
THE LAST FIGHT
</h3>

<p>
Challis wished to get as near as possible to the
Tubus who were collecting the horses without being
discovered.  Accordingly he drew out his men in
line over a long front, and passed the word along
that they must keep a strict silence.
</p>

<p>
Then he signed to them to advance, and they
moved forward swiftly, with the lightness of foot
which is the negroes' birthright.
</p>

<p>
For some distance they were covered by the
undergrowth.  In spite of all their care, it was
inevitable that the passage of so large a number of
men should cause a slight rustling, and they were
still nearly three hundred yards from the horses
when the sound was heard.
</p>

<p>
The Tubus turned round, caught sight of them,
and raised a shout of alarm.  Concealment was no
longer possible.  Challis blew his whistle for the
charge.  His men answered with a fierce yell, and
the whole line swept forward.
</p>

<p>
Challis had scarcely anticipated the effect of the
shrill cries from hundreds of throats.  The Tubus'
horses were seized with panic and plunged wildly.
Their riders, unable to control them, were
themselves terror-stricken at the sight of the long line
of warriors rushing towards them.  Dropping the
horses' bridles, they led the stampede.
</p>

<p>
The mob of men and horses surged towards the
camp, where some of the Tubus were engaged in
making new ladders, the rest cooking or idling.
They dashed through and over them, scattering
them right and left.  Panic spread through the
camp, and before the attackers were within striking
distance, the whole force of the enemy was in
headlong flight.
</p>

<p>
The horses in their blind charge dashed into the
slight grass huts which the Tubus had built and
razed them to the ground.  Challis saw Goruba
spring up from the ruins of one of them, catch at
the bridle of a horse that was running by, and
leap with extraordinary agility upon its back.
</p>

<p>
On went the torrent.  The Tubus who had arms
in their hands at the moment of alarm flung them
away to speed their flight.  Behind them panted
Challis's men, shouting more and more loudly as
they saw the dreaded enemy fleeing before them,
and Challis rejoiced in the prospect of a bloodless
victory.
</p>

<p>
For a little the course was uphill, towards the
fort; but the slope gradually affected the direction,
and the fugitives bore more and more to the right.
At last they disappeared among the brushwood
and woodland to the north of the fort, Goruba,
conspicuous on his horse, striving vainly to check
the flight.
</p>

<p>
When all the horses and men had vanished from
sight, Goruba reappeared after a moment or two
and galloped round the hill to the west, the direction
of the second Tubu camp.
</p>

<p>
Challis had hard work, even with John's assistance,
to keep his men in hand.  Their instinct was
to rush into the wood after the fleeing enemy, and
they could not understand why the white man's
whistle kept on calling them to halt.
</p>

<p>
Their line was quite broken, and it was some
minutes before Challis could reform it.  Even then
it was incomplete, for many of the men, carried
away by their ardour, had dashed among the trees.
</p>

<p>
But the line was reformed only just in time.
Round the base of the hill galloped a force of Tubus
from the second camp, led by Goruba.  It was clear
from the disorder of their ranks that they had
mounted and rushed off without any attempt to
form up.
</p>

<p>
Challis felt a good deal of anxiety about the
result of the approaching collision until he saw
that the Tubus were much fewer in number than
his own men.  Their lack of order also gave him
a great advantage.
</p>

<p>
Shouting to his men to plant their pikes and
stand firm, he awaited the onset.  Goruba and the
foremost of the Tubus charged straight upon
the bristling barrier.  Down they went, though
the impact felled many of the pikemen.  But
their fall caused their comrades behind to hesitate.
Challis was quick to seize the moment.  With a
shrill blast of his whistle he ordered his men to
charge, and the willing negroes, always more ready
to advance than to hold their ground, rushed
forward with an impetuosity that carried all
before it.
</p>

<p>
Some of the Tubus turned at once and galloped
away.  A few stood for several moments, as if
weighing the chances of a countercharge; then
they too, wheeled their horses about and urged
them to a frantic gallop.  Within a few minutes
from the first dash, the hillside in this quarter was
clear.
</p>

<p>
Challis again called off his men, and hastened
to search for Goruba, whom he expected to find
dead or at least seriously wounded on the ground.
But among the fallen enemy there was no trace of
the giant.  He had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Royce, according to his arrangement
with Challis, had dealt with the enemy in the third
camp.  He had almost given up hope when he
heard the first sounds of the fray.
</p>

<p>
The third party of Tubus, when the alarm was
raised, took a course which would have brought
them on the rear of Challis's men.  This had been
foreseen by Royce.  After Challis's departure in
the night, he had had the gateway cleared, except
for a light, movable barrier, in readiness for a sortie.
He had seen from the walls the flight of the first
party of the enemy, and the other two parties
rushing to the rescue, one on Challis's front, the
other on his rear.  Leaving Challis to deal with the
frontal attack, he led his men out through the
gateway to head off the other party.
</p>

<br />
ROYCE LEADS THE CHARGE
</p>

<p>
Unlike Challis, he had fewer men than the enemy,
and less than a third of them were armed.  But
one rifle was of more value than many spears.
The men lined up on the slope of the hill, where
the advancing enemy must come within close range.
At the word of command they fired.
</p>

<p>
The Tubus checked instantly.  They appeared
to hesitate whether to run the gauntlet of the
attack and push on to the support of their comrades
or to remain and fight it out with the garrison of
the fort.  It was evident that they had no leader
of authority, and Royce, like Challis, was quick
to profit by their hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"After me, boys!" he cried, and led the Hausas
in a headlong charge down the hill.
</p>

<p>
Behind them, in a wild, tumultuous mob,
swarmed the other men, some armed with stones,
some with spears, some even with the Tubus' scaling
ladders.
</p>

<p>
The very boldness of the movement decided the
issue.  If the Tubus stopped to think, they must
have supposed that so small a body, in measuring
themselves against overwhelming numbers, was
covered by support from some other quarter.
They fired one scattered volley.  Royce did not
halt his men to reply to it, but bounded on at their
head whooping like a schoolboy, while the Tubus
kicked their horses' flanks and bolted for cover to
the nearest wood.
</p>

<p>
The fight was won.
</p>

<p><a id="chap32"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII
<br /><br />
A HOT CHASE
</h3>

<p>
Royce and Challis met at the foot of the hill.
</p>

<p>
"Splendid, old man!" said the former, gripping
his friend by the hand.  "I had almost given
you up, and my men were in a frightful state of
depression."
</p>

<p>
"Not more depressed than I was," rejoined
Challis with a smile.  "I was depressed sixteen
feet below ground!  But I'll tell you all about
that presently.  Give your men a good feed out
of the reserve provisions we have brought.  I'll
send my lot out to prevent the Tubus from
reuniting; then we'll talk things over."
</p>

<p>
Challis sent three-fourths of his force into the
forest and the surrounding country, with orders
to check any attempt of the scattered Tubus to
combine.  Meanwhile Royce's men revelled in what
was, after their privations, a sumptuous feast.
</p>

<p>
While they were eating Royce and Challis
attended to the few wounded.
</p>

<p>
"It's extraordinary, that so few have been lost
on either side," said Challis.  "It's almost a bloodless
victory.  The Tubus have been vastly over-rated.
They seem more ready to bunk than to fight."
</p>

<p>
"The explanation is simple enough," said Royce.
"They have never met with organised opposition
before.  They have had it all their own way, and
kept the negroes down by the sheer terror of their
name.  Their power is gone for good now."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure of that," returned Challis.
"Goruba is still at large.  He was bowled over
when he charged my pikemen, but he couldn't
have been much hurt, for he got clean away."
</p>

<p>
"That's a pity.  If we had collared him our
victory would have been complete.  None of your
men saw which way he went?"
</p>

<p>
"They didn't say so."
</p>

<p>
"If we could only find out, we might pursue him.
So long as he is at large, he is a danger; he may
rally the fugitives, and when they have got over
their fright they will be a far more formidable
enemy to tackle."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let us round up some horses, in case we
get word of him.  We'll probably find a good many
in the woods."
</p>

<p>
"A good idea.  Some of the Hausas can ride&mdash;I
will send them."
</p>

<p>
He selected half-a-dozen of the Hausas, including
Gambaru and Kulana, and sent them under John's
command to bring in any horses they might find
within a short distance of the fort.  While they
were gone, Challis related the incident of his fall
into the pit.
</p>

<p>
"But for John's disobedience I should never
have got out," he concluded.  "We owe a good
deal to the devotion of our men, Hugh."
</p>

<p>
"We do, indeed, and it shan't go unrewarded.
The way they have stuck to us is magnificent."
</p>

<p>
After about an hour, John and his party returned,
riding on captured horses and leading others.
They also brought several Tubu prisoners,
tied to their saddles.  John was evidently much
excited.
</p>

<p>
"Goruba, sah!" he cried, springing from his
horse.  "Him run away."
</p>

<p>
"We know that," said Royce.  "Which way
did he go?  Did you see him?"
</p>

<p>
"No see him, sah.  Hah!  Him berry clebber
chap, sah, Gamba feel very bad, sure 'nuff."
</p>

<p>
"Who is Gamba?  What do you mean?"
Royce asked.
</p>

<p>
John drew forward one of the prisoners, a tall
young negro slightly wounded in the thigh.
</p>

<p>
"Dis Gamba, sah," John went on.  "Him say
Goruba pull him off horse, knock him boko, sah.
Goruba get a horse, run away all same.  Gamba
berry mad; what for Goruba run away, not him?
Him Tubu, Goruba no Tubu; make him berry
mad, sah."
</p>

<p>
John did not explain himself very clearly; but,
after questioning him patiently, Royce made out
that when Gamba was about to ride away Goruba
pulled him from the saddle, struck him on the head,
and galloped away on his horse.
</p>

<p>
Gamba resented this.  He had always disliked
Goruba as a stranger who had wormed his way
into the confidence of the Tubu chief, and whose
rise to power had awakened the jealousy of many
of the tribe.  He blamed Goruba, too, for the
misfortunes which had lately befallen the
community, and had a personal grudge against him
for appropriating his horse and preventing him
from fleeing to safety.
</p>

<p>
"Which way did Goruba ride?" asked Royce.
</p>

<p>
Gamba explained that Goruba had ridden northwards
towards the Yo, probably to fetch reinforcements
large enough to crush the Englishmen's
party.
</p>

<p>
"He has got a good start," said Royce to Challis.
"but there's just a chance we may catch him if we
go at once."
</p>

<p>
"Especially if this fellow will guide us," said
Challis.
</p>

<p>
In spite of his wound, Gamba was eager to lead
the chase of the man he hated.  Accordingly,
Royce and Challis mounted and, accompanied by
the Tubu and their six Hausas, cantered away
towards the north.  John, much to his
disappointment, was left behind in command of the
men.
</p>

<p>
As they rode on, the Englishmen got more
information from Gamba, Kalana interpreting.  It
turned out that he was a nephew of the childless
chief of the Tubus, and had expected some day
to succeed him, until Goruba appeared on the
scene.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, he had a special affection for the
horse of which he had been deprived.  It was the
fastest horse owned by the tribe, and Goruba had
long coveted it.  He said that if Goruba rode
straight for the Yo and crossed it they would never
catch him.  Their only chance of doing so was that
he might be delayed, or halt for some reason or
other.
</p>

<p>
On learning this Royce quickened the pace.
Gamba led the party almost due north, through
a country which had probably never before been
visited by a white man.  It was broken, hilly
country, for the Yo was still far from the mud
flats that mark its entrance into Lake Chad.
</p>

<p>
They soon had visible proof, in hoof marks, that
more than one horseman had recently ridden in
front of them.  Clearly Goruba was not alone.
Gamba dismounted and examined the tracks.  He
gave a grunt of satisfaction when he discovered
the track of his own horse.
</p>

<p>
When they rode on he seemed to forget that he
was following up an important member of his own
tribe.  All his attention was fixed on recovering
his horse and squaring accounts with a personal
enemy.
</p>

<p>
Keenly scanning the trail as he rode, he pointed
out every now and then spots where stragglers
had joined Goruba, until it was clear that the party
with him numbered eight or nine men.
</p>

<p>
"We needn't bother about them," said Royce.
"You boys, go for Goruba.  You can't mistake
him; he is bigger than the rest.  Don't kill him
if you can help it; he will be more useful to us
alive than dead."
</p>

<p>
The track was easy to follow, and there was
no doubt that Goruba was making straight for
the Yo.  It was not likely that he had given up
the contest, for his treasure was still safe in the
underground cave.
</p>

<p>
Royce hoped that the giant would not meet a
raiding party of Tubus before he reached the
headquarters of the tribe, for with his few
Hausas, armed with rifles though they were, he
would be no match for a large band of the negro
warriors.
</p>

<p>
The sun was hot, and the stiff pace at which
they rode fatigued the whole party.  But Royce
pressed on, hoping to make up for the start of
more than an hour which Goruba had had.
</p>

<p>
At last, early in the afternoon, he caught sight
of the quarry about two miles ahead, disappearing
over the crest of a gentle slope.
</p>

<p>
The pursuers, who were riding down hill, urged
their horses to a gallop.  Easing them up the
slope, they found when they had reached the top
that they had gained nearly half-a-mile on the
fugitives, who were apparently unaware of being
followed.
</p>

<p>
From this point onwards the country was a
succession of ups and downs like a switchback.
The Tubus had disappeared; when next they
were sighted, they had almost gained the top of
another slope.  Royce allowed them to pass from
sight over the skyline, then galloped on to gain
on them once more.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto the ground had been fairly open, but
it became more wooded as they proceeded.  The
Tubus were hidden when the pursuers got to the
crest of the hill.  They gave their horses a breather,
and then pushed on at full speed over a rough
forest track.  Royce was leading with Gamba,
Challis and the rest following in single file.
</p>

<p>
It was impossible to see more than about a
hundred yards in front, owing to the winding of
the path among the trees.  Suddenly the rearmost
of the Tubus came into sight about eighty
yards ahead.  At the same moment he heard
the thuds of the pursuers' horses, turned in his
saddle, and, shouting with alarm, urged his horse
forward.
</p>

<p>
"After them!" cried Royce, digging his heels
into his horse's flanks.
</p>

<p>
A turn of the path brought the whole nine of the
fugitives into view.  The path narrowed, so that
there was only room for one horseman to ride at a
time.  The better mounted of the Tubus tried to
pass the slower, with the result that some were
edged off into the wood on either side, and tried
to force their way through the entangling vegetation.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind about them," cried Royce, who
had seen Goruba's huge form galloping ahead of
two others.
</p>

<p>
It was a wild ride.  In some places the branches
of trees hung down over the path, and the pursuers
had to dodge them by bending low on their horses'
necks.  At other places the path itself was
obstructed by fallen boughs and by masses of creepers,
so that both pursuers and pursued had the utmost
difficulty in avoiding a fall.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p268"></a>
Royce, with his eyes fixed on Goruba, narrowly
escaped coming a cropper, and was only saved by
the sure-footedness of his horse, accustomed to
running in this wild forest country.  Gambaru was
struck from his saddle by an overhanging branch,
and Challis, close behind him, pulled up just in
time to avoid riding over him.
</p>

<p>
One of the Tubus riding behind Goruba edged
his companion off into the thicket.  Royce, close
on his heels, shot out his left arm as he passed and
threw the man from his seat.
</p>

<p>
Then, just as his horse was steadily overhauling
the man in front, there was a sudden dramatic
development.
</p>

<p>
Goruba glanced round, took the measure of the
situation, and drawing a pistol, while still riding
at full speed, deliberately shot the horse of his
follower.  The beast fell with its rider.  Royce
was unable to check his horse in time; it turned a
somersault over the fallen animal, and Royce was
shot over its head into a thorn bush several yards
away.
</p>

<p>
The Hausas yelled with alarm and reined up.
Challis, forgetting Goruba in his anxiety for his
friend, sprang from his horse and ran to assist him
as he rose, torn and bleeding, from the merciless
thorns.
</p>

<p>
For a few seconds Royce was too dazed with pain
and shock to think or speak.  Then, collecting his
wits, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Don't bother about me!  After Goruba&mdash;don't
let him escape."
</p>

<p>
But Goruba had reckoned on the confusion and
delay which his shooting the horse would occasion.
By the time that Challis had remounted and
dashed on in pursuit, the bold negro was out of
sight.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII
<br /><br />
THE END OF GORUBA
</h3>

<p>
While Royce was recovering from the shock of
his fall, Challis and some of the men, including
Gamba, the young Tubu, galloped on in the hope
of overtaking Goruba.  But when they had ridden
for a mile or two without catching sight of him,
Challis pulled up, unwilling to leave Royce with
only two or three men to support him in case the
scattered Tubus attacked.
</p>

<p>
Riding back, he had not gone far, however, when
he met Royce and the rest of the party.
</p>

<p>
"There are no bones broken; I'm all right
now," cried Royce.  "I suppose Goruba has got
away?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, confound him!  He's as difficult to catch
as a weasel.  Is it any good going on?"
</p>

<p>
"We won't give it up yet," replied Royce.
"He may delay to collect his scattered band, and
if we can catch him before he gets to the ford over
the Yo it will be a great score for us.  He would
be invaluable as a hostage, to say the least of it."
</p>

<p>
Gamba, smarting at the loss of his horse, was
eager to push on, though he admitted that it
would be difficult to overtake the best horse of
the tribe.  Only by accident could the pursuit
succeed.
</p>

<p>
The party rode on at their best pace.  The
country soon became more rocky, and on the
harder soil they lost the tracks of Goruba's horse.
But this was of no importance.  Gamba was sure
that the man would make for the Yo, and the
nearest ford was about two hours' ride from the
spot where Royce had come to grief.  Towards
that ford he led the way, often outstripping the
rest of the party in his eagerness.
</p>

<p>
But there was never a sign of Goruba.  They
scanned the crest of every rise in the ground,
hoping to see the big form on the sky-line.  Neither
horse nor man came within their view.
</p>

<p>
At last they arrived at the river, and Gamba
galloped at headlong pace down to the ford.  There
he sprang from his horse and feverishly examined
the tracks on the softer soil.  To his surprise and
dismay, there were none very recent, and those
there were all pointed in the opposite direction.
It was clear that no horseman had crossed to the
northern bank for some weeks past.
</p>

<p>
Baffled, he rode up and down stream to see if
Goruba had avoided the ford, and perhaps swum
his horse across the river at some other point.
While he was doing this Royce crossed at the ford,
and examined the ground on the opposite bank,
and Challis sent some of the men to scour the
neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
After a long search they had to confess utter
failure.  In no direction was there any trace of
Goruba's horse.  Goruba had given them the slip.
</p>

<p>
Gamba wept with disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"It's enough to make any one snivel," said
Challis.  "What can have become of the fellow?"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever it is, we are done brown," said
Royce.  "It's no good riding any farther; we
might tumble among a whole swarm of Tubus.
And as it's getting late, we had better camp for
the night, and then go back and digest our
disappointment as well as we can."
</p>

<p>
At this moment Gamba gave a succession of
peculiar shrill whistles.
</p>

<p>
"What's that mean?" asked Royce.
</p>

<p>
Gambaru explained that the man was whistling
for his horse, thinking that Goruba had possibly
left it some distance from the river and swum across,
so that hoof marks might not betray him.  But
the signals were ineffective, and Gamba wept again.
</p>

<p>
Retreating from the bank, they formed a camp
on a sheltered hillside, ate some of the food they
had brought with them, and settled down for the
night, arranging for the men to keep watch in turn.
Nothing disturbed them, and early in the morning
they started back for the fort.
</p>

<p>
On the way they caught sight of many stray
Tubus making their way towards the river.  These
always slunk away when they saw the Englishmen,
who did not think it worth while to pursue them.
They already had enough prisoners, and shrank
from further bloodshed.
</p>

<p>
They reached the fort just before noon.  The
fort itself had not been occupied during the night.
John reported that the men had conceived such a
horror of it that they preferred to remain in the
open.  The Tubus had wholly disappeared.  Their
failure and the flight of their leader had broken
their spirit.
</p>

<p>
Some of the victorious natives had already gone
back to their homes to relate how the dreaded
Tubus had been defeated.
</p>

<p>
"We couldn't hope for anything better," said
Royce.  "The whole countryside will hear of it
in a day or two; the prestige of the Tubus will be
utterly shattered, and the people won't be afraid
of them any longer.  I rather fancy they will
keep to their own side of the Yo in the future."
</p>

<p>
"If they do, we'll have done some good in the
world," said Challis.  "But now, old man, I want
to see Rabeh's hoard.  What's going to happen to
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose it is fair spoil of war, but I
haven't given a thought to the question as to what
we shall do with it.  We'll have to get it up
and that will take some time; there's such a lot
of it.  I'll take you down the well for a private
view.  Then we'll have the barrier removed from
the entrance in the wood and get the men to bring
the stuff into the open."
</p>

<p>
They walked up the hill and climbed into the
fort, where Challis was interested to see the changes
made during his absence.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to have been an officer in the
Royal Engineers, Hugh," he said.
</p>

<p>
Royce grinned.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be an ass!" was all he said.
</p>

<p>
They reached the well-room.
</p>

<p>
"Just wait up here until I get the door open,"
said Royce, as he stepped over the coping and began
to descend by the iron staples.
</p>

<p>
Challis leant over the edge, watching him.
Below, the depths of the well were dark, and he
could hear the slight gurgle of the spring at the
bottom.
</p>

<p>
"I say," came Royce's voice, "the door's open!
I left it shut.  One of the men must have been
prying, in spite of what John said about their
horror."
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to make an example of him!  Shall
I come down?"
</p>

<p>
"Wait a bit.  My electric torch has given out.
Have you got a match?"
</p>

<p>
"Not one.  There's a box among our stores,
though.  I'll get it and bring it down to you."
</p>

<p>
He went to the room where the stores were kept.
Meanwhile Royce, always impatient, passed through
the opening in the wall and began to creep slowly
along the tunnel.
</p>

<p>
Challis, having found a box of matches, was
returning to the well when he was amazed to see a
black, fuzzy head appear over the coping.  For a
moment he imagined that it belonged to one of
Royce's own men whom he had routed out of the
tunnel, but at a second glance he realised his
mistake.  The man's black cheeks bore Rabeh's telltale
scars.  It was Goruba.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-275"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-275.jpg" alt="GORUBA CLIMBS THE WELL" />
<br />
GORUBA CLIMBS THE WELL
</p>

<p>
With a shout, Challis dashed forward.  Goruba's
shoulders were now above the coping.  In his
right hand he bore a knife, and his eyes gleamed
with rage.  Challis was unarmed.  His only chance
was to deal with the negro before he had fully
emerged from the well.
</p>

<p>
Shooting out his right arm, he brought his fist
with sledge-hammer force upon Goruba's brow,
between the eyes, just as the man was about to
launch himself over the coping.  The negro
staggered back, lost his balance, and fell head over
heels into the well.  There was a thud, then a
splash&mdash;and then Royce's voice from the opening:
</p>

<p>
"What's the row, Tom?  When are you coming
down with those matches?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap34"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV
<br /><br />
THE GREAT REWARD
</h3>

<p>
Challis shuddered with horror as he realised
how narrow Royce's escape had been.  A moment
later, and Royce must have been dashed from his
footing on the staple by the massive form of Goruba,
and have fallen, like him, to the bottom of the
well.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry up, Tom!  What are you so long about,
man?" Royce asked.
</p>

<p>
Challis leant over the coping.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said, conscious that his voice
was shaking.  "Just a minute."
</p>

<p>
Pulling himself together, he set his foot on the
first staple and began to descend very slowly, not
daring to look down into the black depths.  He
reached the hole in the wall, struck a match, lit
a candle end he had in his pocket, and followed
Royce into the tunnel.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" asked Royce.  "You're as white
as a sheet.  Surely that little bit of a climb didn't
make you dizzy?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm all right.  Goruba's gone!"
</p>

<p>
"Gone?  What do you mean?  Of course he's gone."
</p>

<p>
"Down the well," said Challis, almost in a
whisper.  "He was climbing up with a knife.  I
went for him, and he fell."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Royce was speechless with
astonishment.  Then he said:
</p>

<p>
"But I don't understand.  Where did he come
from?  He didn't pass me.  Are you sure it was
Goruba?"
</p>

<p>
"Certain.  It was horrible."
</p>

<p>
"Poor old chap!  Look here, you're shaken.
Rest a bit while I go down.  Perhaps the fellow
isn't much hurt."
</p>

<p>
He took the candle from Challis's hand and went
carefully down by the staples to the bottom of the
well.  There, huddled in a pool of water, lay all
that was left of the gigantic negro.  He was quite
dead.  It was clear that in his descent he had
struck the stone slab projecting into the well.  His
neck was broken.
</p>

<p>
Awed by this strange tragedy, puzzled at the
presence of Goruba here, Royce climbed up again
and rejoined his friend.
</p>

<p>
"The poor wretch is dead," he said.  "What
an extraordinary fatality!  He must have been
in the darkness below.  But what could he have
been doing there?"
</p>

<p>
Together they sat on the stone floor with the
candle between them.  For some time neither
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I see part of the explanation," said Challis at
last.  "When he escaped from us he must have
guessed that we should continue the pursuit, and
slipped back at full speed to secure his treasure,
or some of it, in our absence."
</p>

<p>
"The ruling passion!" said Royce.  "Yes,
that's it.  But still I don't understand why he was
down the well.  If I had met him in the tunnel,
now, there would have been no mystery about it."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he was in the room above, saw us
coming, and came down to be out of our way."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! and to follow us through the tunnel and
stab us in the back.  That's it, to a certainty.
Your going back for the matches saved our lives,
Tom."
</p>

<p>
"We've a lot to be thankful for," said Challis.
</p>

<p>
"We have indeed! ... Now for Rabeh's hoard,
old man."
</p>

<p>
They went along the tunnel, found the slab in
the floor, lifted it, and made their way into the
cave.  Challis gasped when he saw the immense
array of tusks.
</p>

<p>
"They are worth a fortune," he said.  "No
wonder Goruba wanted to drive us out."
</p>

<p>
"He has been moving things!" exclaimed
Royce.  "That row at the end there isn't as I left
it.  At least a dozen tusks are gone.  I wonder
what he has done with them.  Let us go on to the
farther entrance."
</p>

<p>
But halfway through the narrow tunnel beyond
they found the path blocked.  From floor to roof
the tunnel was choked with a mass of earth, plants,
and trees.
</p>

<p>
"The roof has fallen in," said Royce, scanning
the obstruction by the light of the candle.  "Things
are becoming clearer.  Look!  Here's a tusk.
Goruba must have been carrying it, or lugging it,
for it's tremendously heavy, when the ground
above sank.  That accounts for his being at the
other end.  We shall have to go back, enter from
the wood, and get our men to clear the rubbish
away."
</p>

<p>
They retraced their steps, and rejoining their
men, led a party of them into the wood.
</p>

<p>
"Here's a horse tethered!" cried Challis.  "I
wonder if it is Gamba's."
</p>

<p>
He sent Gambaru back to fetch the man, who
the moment he caught sight of the horse yelled
with delight, threw his arms round the animal's
neck, and allowed it to rub its nose over his back.
Then he sprang into the saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Not so fast," cried Royce, catching at the
bridle.  "Tell him I can't let him go yet, Gambaru.
We must have a talk first.  Keep him safe until I
have time to attend to him."
</p>

<p>
He took the men on to the concealed entrance.
Goruba had patiently removed the material with
which it had been blocked up.  Leading the men
to the spot where the subsidence had occurred,
Royce ordered them to clear away the rubbish and
then report to him.
</p>

<p>
"Now we must find the tusks he removed," he
said to Challis.  "I daresay they are hidden
somewhere in the undergrowth."
</p>

<p>
But though a hundred men spent hours in searching
the wood, no trace of the tusks was discovered.
It was not until later in the day that the mystery
was solved.  Some of the negroes, who had gone
down to the stream to fetch water for their evening
meal, came running back in great excitement.
They had seen two long, yellow tusks gleaming
through the water.  Royce at once went to the
stream with a number of Hausas, who hauled out
the tusks, and after searching for some time found
ten others concealed under the bank.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the tunnel had been cleared, and
Challis superintended the men as they brought
the whole treasure out into the open air.  Some
of them knew that the ivory was very valuable,
others were more interested in the useless objects,
like the kepi, a rusty sword or two, and particularly
a gilt mirror, in which they examined their smiling
features with great delight.
</p>

<p>
When the cave was cleared, Royce put John in
charge of the treasure and sent for Gamba.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to let you return to your chief,"
he said.  "You will take him a message from me.
Goruba is dead.  He lies at the bottom of the well
in the fort.  Your people may fetch him, if they
will.  He coveted this treasure, which was stolen,
I have no doubt, by his master Rabeh.  It is now
mine.
</p>

<p>
"You will tell your chief all that has happened,
how we have beaten his men in fair fight, how their
man Goruba has met his death through greed.  You
will tell him that we will fight his men again if they
come to this side of the Yo.  These people are no
longer afraid of the Tubus.  They mean to be
left in peace.  Tell your chief that.
</p>

<p>
"We have taken some forty Tubus prisoners.
We shall keep them until your chief sends word
that he will do as I say, and keep his men from
raiding on this side of the river.  The country here
belongs to the Great White King, and if your people
do wrong again, the Great White King will send
men with big medicine to punish you.  Now you
may go, and remember my words."
</p>

<p>
Gambaru translated this solemnly, sentence by
sentence, and Gamba listened gravely.  When he
had permission to go, he leapt upon his horse, gave
a shrill whistle, and galloped away to the north.
</p>

<p>
"I hope the Tubus have learnt their lesson,"
said Royce to Challis.  "Now what are we to do
with this ivory?  I suppose it is booty, fairly won
in war, but we ought to go shares with the crowd."
</p>

<p>
"You mean turn it into money?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, though money will be no good to the
negroes.  The first thing, at any rate, is to carry
it to the coast.  I think our Tubu prisoners might
do that for us.  We'll sell it, and consult somebody,
a missionary perhaps, as to what we can best do
for the people."
</p>

<p>
"What about the tin mine?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, we shall simply have to come back again.
It's a terrible loss of time, but, after all, we're in
no hurry to be rich, and if we have managed to
secure the peace of this country we shan't regret
our trouble.  Don't you agree with me?"
</p>

<p>
"With all my heart.  It's a sort of lesson to us,
Hugh.  We came out thinking only of ourselves,
and in this strange way we have been led to think
of others.  It's a fine thing to have been able to do
some good in the world."
</p>

<p>
Next day the whole company set off for the south,
the Tubus being laden with the ivory.  It was a
sort of triumphal progress for the Englishmen.  The
tale of their doings had already been carried through
the country, and at every village through which
they passed the people could not do enough to show
their gratitude.
</p>

<p>
The party grew smaller every day as men broke
away to rejoin their own people.  When the coast
was reached, after weeks of toilsome marching,
the Englishmen had with them only their Hausa
boys, the Tubu prisoners, and a few men from
various tribes who clung to them because they
wished to see the strange and wonderful things
about which the Hausas had told them.
</p>

<p>
The ivory fetched £3000, a sum much in excess of
what the Englishmen had expected.  Royce, who
had plenty of money, refused to accept any part of
the proceeds for himself.  Challis, after some
consideration, decided that £1000 would come in very
useful in buying machinery for his tin mine.
</p>

<p>
They happened to meet a medical missionary
and his wife who had just arrived from England.
To them they handed over £2000 on condition that
they would use it for the good of the natives south
of the Yo.  And when, after a month's rest, they
returned to the scene of their adventures, they
were accompanied by the missionaries and a new
band of Hausa boys, with John again as headman.
The old band felt so rich on the generous pay they
had received that they meant to retire from
business, at least for a time.
</p>

<p>
John treated them with contempt.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty silly chaps," he said.  "Dey hab got
lots of cash; me savvy all same.  What dey do?
Spend, spend, spend all time.  Bimeby all gone.
What do den, sah?  Dey want 'nother massa; no
can find one.  Dey go sick.  Wah!  Me hab got
good massa; me savvy all dat, sure 'nuff."
</p>

<p>
When Royce and Challis were last heard of they
were working a rich tin mine, with two hundred
contented negro labourers in their employment.
A little settlement had sprung up in the midst of
the great plain, with two large bungalows, one for
Royce and Challis, the other for the missionary and
his wife, and a number of neat grass huts for the
labourers and their families.
</p>

<p>
The country in their immediate neighbourhood
was troubled no more by the Tubus.  A brisk
trade grew up between their settlement and the
surrounding villages, and once a year the people
for miles around go in procession to visit the white
men, carrying presents for the strangers who saved
them from the raiders and brought peace and
prosperity to the countryside.

"I envy the boy or girl who is given a Herbert Strang book....
Mr. Strang's powers of invention are great.  One is hurried
along breathlessly from one adventure to another, till we are
left gasping at the end of the jolly narrative....  Mr. Strang's
books are full of the qualities to which boys&mdash;and girls&mdash;should
aspire.  Reading him, an older, less adventurous person 'lives
by admiration.'"&mdash;KATHARINE TYNAN.
</p>

<p>
"The intellectual level of boys' stories has been materially
raised by Mr. Strang, and at the same time he has infused into
them a stronger human interest than the old writers did.  The
gain is an all-round one....  Mr. Strang has brought the boys'
story up to the same level of artistic effort and realisation as
the high-class novel."&mdash;JAMES BURNLEY.
</p>

<p>
"We rejoice to find that among the crowd of money-makers
who produce as if by machinery the standard book for boys,
there are still some who realise that because only a boy is to
read a book it need not therefore be careless, and because the
boy will be without experience the book need not therefore be
impossible."&mdash;THE OUTLOOK.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Strang's books suggest a standard by which very few
writers of boys' books will bear being judged.  The majority of
them are content to provide their young friends with mere
reading&mdash;Herbert Strang offers them literature."&mdash;THE
GLASGOW HERALD.

<p class="t3b">
The Air Patrol
</p>

<p class="t3">
A Story of the North-West Frontier.
</p>

<p class="t3">
Illustrated in colour by CYRUS CUNEO.
</p>

<p>
In this book Mr. Strang looks ahead&mdash;and other books have already proved
him a prophet of surprising skill&mdash;to
a time when there is a great Mongolian
Empire whose army sweeps down on the North-West Frontier of India.  His
two heroes luckily have an aeroplane, and with the help of a few Pathan
miners they hold a pass in the Hindu Kush against a swarm of Mongols, long
enough to prevent the cutting of the communications of the Indian army
operating in Afghanistan.  The qualities which marked Mr. Strang's story,
"The Air Scout," and won extraordinarily high commendation from Lord
Roberts, Lord Curzon, and others,
as well as from the <i>Spectator</i> and other
great journals, are again strikingly displayed;
and the combination of thrilling
adventure with an Imperial problem and excellent writing, adds one more to
this author's long list of successes.

<p class="t3">
A Story of National Defence.
</p>

<p class="t3">
Illustrated in Colour by W. R. S. STOTT.
</p>

<p>
The problems of National Defence are being discussed with more and more
care and attention, not only in Great Britain, but also in all parts of the
Empire.  In this story Mr. Strang
imagines a Chinese descent upon Australia,
and carries his hero through a series of exciting adventures, in which the
value of national spirit, organisation, and discipline is exemplified.  The
important part which the aeroplane will play
in warfare is recognised, and the
thousands of readers who have delighted in the author's previous stories of
aviation will find this new book after their own heart.
</p>

<p class="quote">
LORD ROBERTS wrote:&mdash;"It is capital reading, and should interest more than
boys.  Your forecast is so good that I
can only hope the future may not bring to
Australia such a struggle as the one you so graphically describe."
</p>

<p class="quote">
LORD CURZON writes:&mdash;"I have read with great pleasure your book, 'The Air
Scout.'  It seems to me to be a capital story,
full of life and movement: and further,
it preaches the best of all secular gospels, patriotism and co-operation."

The Adventures of Dick Trevanion

<p class="t3">
A story of 1804.
</p>

<p class="t3">
Illustrated in Colour by W. RAINEY, R.I.
</p>

<p>
The Trevanions are a Cornish family whose fortunes have fallen very low
through the working-out of their tin mines and the scheming of a relative
who bears a grudge against the head of the house.  In this story, dated in
the early years of the 19th century,
the author weaves together various strands:
the war with Napoleon, the operations of smugglers, the machinations of the
schemer, and the change in the fortunes of the family which ensued upon
various alarums and excursions.

</p>

<p class="t3">
Illustrated In Colour by W. H. MARGETSON.
</p>

<p>
In this story are recounted the many adventures that befell Humphrey
Bold of Shrewsbury, from the time when,
a puny slip of a boy, he was befriended
by Joe Punchard, the cooper's apprentice
(who nearly shook the life out of his
tormentor, Cyrus Vetch, by rolling him down
the Wyle Cop in a barrel), to the
day when, grown into a sturdy young giant,
he sailed into Plymouth Sound as
first lieutenant of the <i>Bristol</i> frigate.
The intervening chapters teem with
exciting incidents, telling of sea-fights
with that redoubtable privateer Duguay
Trouin; of Humphrey's escape from a French prison; of his voyage to the
West Indies and all the perils he encountered there.

Palm Tree Island.
</p>

<p class="t3">
Illustrated in Colour by ARCHIBALD WEBB.
</p>

<p>
In this story two boys are left on a volcanic island in the South Seas,
destitute of everything but their clothes.
The story relates how they provided
themselves with food and shelter, with tools and weapons; how they fought
with wild dogs and sea monsters; and how, when they have settled down to a
comfortable life under the shadow of the volcano,
their peace is disturbed by
the advent of savages and a crew of mutinous Englishmen.  The savages are
driven away; the mutineers are subdued
through the boys' ingenuity; and they
ultimately sail away in a vessel of their own construction.
In no other book
has the author more admirably blended amusement with instruction.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
